EGFR signaling is augmented by Src-family kinases, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that human EGFR preferentially phosphorylates peptide substrates that are primed by a prior phosphorylation. Using peptides based on the sequence of the adaptor protein Shc1, we show that Src mediates the priming phosphorylation, thus promoting subsequent phosphorylation by EGFR. Importantly, the doubly phosphorylated Shc1 peptide binds more tightly than singly phosphorylated peptide to the Ras activator Grb2; this binding is a key step in activating the Ras-MAPK pathway. Finally, a crystal structure of EGFR in complex with a primed Shc1 peptide reveals the structural basis for EGFR substrate specificity. These results provide a molecular explanation for the integration of Src and EGFR signaling with downstream effectors such as Ras. ","60":"The LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase phosphorylates and activates a number of protein kinases belonging to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) subfamily. We have used a modified tandem affinity purification strategy to identify proteins that interact with AMPKalpha, as well as the twelve AMPK-related kinases that are activated by LKB1. The AMPKbeta and AMPKgamma regulatory subunits were associated with AMPKalpha, but not with any of the AMPK-related kinases, explaining why AMP does not influence the activity of these enzymes. In addition, we identified novel binding partners that interacted with one or more of the AMPK subfamily enzymes, including fat facets\/ubiquitin specific protease-9 (USP9), AAA-ATPase-p97, adenine nucleotide translocase, protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme and isoforms of the phospho-protein binding adaptor 14-3-3. Interestingly, the 14-3-3 isoforms bound directly to the T-loop Thr residue of QSK and SIK, after these were phosphorylated by LKB1. Consistent with this, the 14-3-3 isoforms failed to interact with non-phosphorylated QSK and SIK, in LKB1 knockout muscle or in HeLa cells in which LKB1 is not expressed. Moreover, mutation of the T-loop Thr phosphorylated by LKB1, prevented QSK and SIK from interacting with 14-3-3 in vitro. Binding of 14-3-3 to QSK and SIK, enhanced catalytic activity towards the TORC2 protein and the AMARA peptide, and was required for the cytoplasmic localization of SIK and for localization of QSK to punctate structures within the cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this study provides the first example of 14-3-3 binding directly to the T-loop of a protein kinase and influencing its catalytic activity and cellular localization.","70":"We recently identified a novel actin cytoskeleton-associated protein magicin, for merlin and Grb2 interacting cytoskeletal protein. To unravel the cellular functions of magicin, we used a yeast two-hybrid system and identified Fyn tyrosine kinase as a specific binding partner for magicin. Fyn phosphorylates magicin in vitro. In addition to Fyn, Src and Lck also interact with magicin. Upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody, magicin is phosphorylated in the T lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cell line. Magicin phosphorylation is not observed in an Lck-deficient line, J.CaM1.6, indicating that Lck is the major Src family kinase for phosphorylating magicin in Jurkat cells. Employing site-directed mutagenesis along with in vitro kinase assays, we found that Y64 of magicin is phosphorylated by Lck creating a SH2-Grb2 binding motif. Magicin has also been identified as a Mediator subunit (MED28) in the nucleus involved in transcriptional regulation, therefore we propose that magicin may serve as a multi-faceted adaptor\/scaffold to relay cellular signaling to the cytoskeleton and from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus.","1149":"Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)\/Rel transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory responses, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and development. There are increasing lines of evidence that NF-kappa B\/Rel activity is controlled to a great extent by its phosphorylation state. In this study, we demonstrated that RelA physically associated with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit A (PR65). Both the N- and C-terminal regions of RelA were responsible for the PP2A binding. RelA co-immunoprecipitated with PP2A in melanocytes in the absence of stimulation, indicating that RelA forms a signaling complex with PP2A in the cells. RelA was dephosphorylated by a purified PP2A core enzyme, a heterodimer formed by the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) and PR65, in a concentration-dependent manner. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A at lower concentration, increased the basal phosphorylation of RelA in melanocytes and blocked the dephosphorylation of RelA after interleukin-1 stimulation. Interestingly, PP2A immunoprecipitated from melanocytes was able to dephosphorylate RelA, whereas PP2A immunoprecipitated from melanoma cell lines exhibited decreased capacity to dephosphorylate RelA in vitro. Moreover, in melanoma cells in which I kappa B kinase activity was inhibited by sulindac to a similar level as in melanocytes, the phosphorylation state of RelA and the relative NF-kappa B activity were still higher than those in normal melanocytes. These data suggest that the constitutive activation of RelA in melanoma cells (Yang, J., and Richmond, A. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 4901-4909) could be due, at least in part, to the deficiency of PP2A, which exhibits decreased dephosphorylation of NF-kappa B\/RelA.","878":"Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an essential role in antigen receptor-initiated lymphocyte activation. Their activity is largely regulated by a negative regulatory tyrosine which is a substrate for the activating action of the CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) or, conversely, the suppressing action of the cytosolic p50csk PTK. Here we report that CD45 was phosphorylated by p50csk on two tyrosine residues, one of them identified as Tyr-1193. This residue was not phosphorylated by T-cell PTKs p56lck and p59fyn. Tyr-1193 was phosphorylated in intact T cells, and phosphorylation increased upon treatment with PTPase inhibitors, indicating that this tyrosine is a target for a constitutively active PTK. Cotransfection of CD45 and csk into COS-1 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 in the intact cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CD45 bound p56lck through the SH2 domain of the kinase. Finally, p50csk-mediated phosphorylation of CD45 caused a severalfold increase in its PTPase activity. Our results show that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 can affect its activity and association with Src family PTKs and that this phosphorylation could be mediated by p50csk. If this is also true in the intact cells, it adds a new dimension to the physiological function of p50csk in T lymphocytes.","790":"We performed a kinome-wide siRNA screen and identified 70 kinases altering cell migration in A549 lung cancer cells. In particular, ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) silencing increased, whereas RSK2 and RSK4 downregulation inhibited cell motility. In a secondary collagen-based three-dimensional invasion screen, 38 of our hits cross-validated, including RSK1 and RSK4. In two further lung cancer cell lines, RSK1 but not RSK4 silencing showed identical modulation of cell motility. We therefore selected RSK1 for further investigation. Bioinformatic analysis followed by co-immunoprecipitation-based validation revealed that the actin regulators VASP and Mena interact with RSK1. Moreover, RSK1 phosphorylated VASP on T278, a site regulating its binding to actin. In addition, silencing of RSK1 enhanced the metastatic potential of these cells in vivo using a zebrafish model. Finally, we investigated the relevance of this finding in human lung cancer samples. In isogenically matched tissue, RSK1 was reduced in metastatic versus primary lung cancer lesions. Moreover, patients with RSK1-negative lung tumours showed increased number of metastases. Our results suggest that the findings of our high-throughput in vitro screen can reliably identify relevant clinical targets and as a proof of principle, RSK1 may provide a biomarker for metastasis in lung cancer patients.","794":"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is a protein subject to hypusination, which is essential for its function. eIF5A is also acetylated, but the role of that modification is unknown. Here, we report that acetylation regulates the subcellular localization of eIF5A. We identified PCAF as the major cellular acetyltransferase of eIF5A, and HDAC6 and SIRT2 as its major deacetylases. Inhibition of the deacetylases or impaired hypusination increased acetylation of eIF5A, leading to nuclear accumulation. As eIF5A is constitutively hypusinated under physiological conditions, we suggest that reversible acetylation plays a major role in controlling the subcellular localization of eIF5A.","271":"Although Niban is highly expressed in human cancer cells, the cellular functions of Niban remain largely unknown. We demonstrate here that ultraviolet irradiation induces phosphorylation of Niban at S602 by AKT, which increases the association of Niban with nucleophosmin and disassociation of nucleophosmin from the MDM2 complex. This leads to the promotion of MDM2-p53 interaction and subsequent p53 degradation, thereby providing an antiapoptotic effect. Conversely, depletion of or deficiency in Niban expression promotes stabilization of p53 with increased cell apoptosis. Our findings illustrate a pivotal role for AKT-mediated phosphorylation of Niban in protecting cells from genotoxic stress-induced cell apoptosis.","1126":"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (SMC1, SMC3) are evolutionarily conserved chromosomal proteins that are components of the cohesin complex, necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. These proteins may also function in DNA repair. Here we report that SMC1 is a component of the DNA damage response network that functions as an effector in the ATM\/NBS1-dependent S-phase checkpoint pathway. SMC1 associates with BRCA1 and is phosphorylated in response to IR in an ATM- and NBS1-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, we established that ATM phosphorylates S957 and S966 of SMC1 in vivo. Phosphorylation of S957 and\/or S966 of SMC1 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint in response to IR. We also discovered that the phosphorylation of NBS1 by ATM is required for the phosphorylation of SMC1, establishing the role of NBS1 as an adaptor in the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 pathway. The ATM\/CHK2\/CDC25A pathway is also involved in the S-phase checkpoint activation, but this pathway is intact in NBS cells. Our results indicate that the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 pathway is a separate branch of the S-phase checkpoint pathway, distinct from the ATM\/CHK2\/CDC25A branch. Therefore, this work establishes the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 branch, and provides a molecular basis for the S-phase checkpoint defect in NBS cells.","1278":"In an effort to clone novel tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the epidermal growth factor receptor, we have initiated an approach coupling affinity purification using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to mass spectrometry-based identification. Here, we report the identification of a signaling molecule containing a Src homology 3 domain as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This molecule is 55% identical to a previously isolated molecule designated signal transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) that was identified as an interleukin (IL)-2-induced phosphoprotein and is therefore designated STAM2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2 is induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor as well as by cytokines like IL-3. Several of the deletion mutants tested except the one containing only the amino-terminal region underwent tyrosine phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation, implying that STAM2 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues. STAM2 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of STAM2 with Jak1 or Jak2 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase, Etk, resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to epidermal growth factor receptor-induced phosphorylation, this required the ITAM domain since mutants lacking this region did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, overexpression of wild type STAM2 led to an increase in IL-2-mediated induction of c-Myc promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling.","363":"Individuals carrying a mutation in one of the three cerebral cavernous malformation genes (CCM1\/KRIT1, CCM2, CCM3) cannot be clinically distinguished, raising the possibility that they act within common molecular pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that CCM3 (PDCD10) coprecipitates and colocalizes with CCM2. We also show that CCM3 directly binds to serine\/threonine kinase 25 (STK25, YSK1, SOK1) and the phosphatase domain of Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1, PTPN13, PTP-Bas, PTP-BL). CCM3 is phosphorylated by STK25 but not by its other Yeast-Two hybrid interactor STK24, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain of FAP-1 dephosphorylates CCM3. Finally, our experiments reveal that STK25 forms a protein complex with CCM2. Thus, our data link two proteins of unknown function, CCM3 and STK25, with CCM2, which is part of signaling pathways essential for vascular development and CCM pathogenesis.","846":"We address here the involvement of the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2)\/p53 complex on MDM2 regulation following apoptotic DNA damage. Our results provide a plausible transcriptional (p53-dependent) and posttranscriptional (p53-independent) double mechanism by which HIPK2 accomplishes MDM2 downmodulation. First, in wtp53-carrying cells HIPK2-dependent p53Ser46 phosphorylation selectively inhibits MDM2 at transcriptional level. Secondly, HIPK2 interacts with MDM2 in vitro and in vivo and promotes MDM2 nuclear export and proteasomal degradation, in p53-null cellular context. This p53-independent effect is likely mediated by HIPK2 catalytic activity and we found that HIPK2 phosphorylates MDM2 in vitro. In response to DNA damage, depletion of HIPK2 by RNA-interference abolishes MDM2 protein degradation. We propose that HIPK2 contributes to drug-induced modulation of MDM2 activity at transcriptional (through p53Ser46 phosphorylation) and posttranscriptional (through p53-independent subcellular re-localization and proteasomal degradation) levels.","579":"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) plays a critical role in recruiting the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. In response to insulin, eIF4B is phosphorylated on Ser422 by S6K in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Here we demonstrate that the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK) phosphorylates eIF4B on the same residue. The relative contribution of the RSK and S6K modules to the phosphorylation of eIF4B is growth factor-dependent, and the two phosphorylation events exhibit very different kinetics. The S6K and RSK proteins are members of the AGC protein kinase family, and require PDK1 phosphorylation for activation. Consistent with this requirement, phosphorylation of eIF4B Ser422 is abrogated in PDK1 null embryonic stem cells. Phosphorylation of eIF4B on Ser422 by RSK and S6K is physiologically significant, as it increases the interaction of eIF4B with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3.","380":"Here we show that 14-3-3 proteins bind to Pim kinase-phosphorylated Ser166 and Ser186 on the human E3 ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2), but not protein kinase B (PKB)\/Akt-phosphorylated Ser166 and Ser188. Pim-mediated phosphorylation of Ser186 blocks phosphorylation of Ser188 by PKB, indicating potential interplay between the Pim and PKB signaling pathways in regulating Mdm2. In cells, expression of Pim kinases promoted phosphorylation of Ser166 and Ser186, interaction of Mdm2 with endogenous 14-3-3s and p14(ARF), and also increased the amount of Mdm2 protein by a mechanism that does not require Pim kinase activities. The implications of these findings for regulation of the p53 pathway, oncogenesis and drug discovery are discussed.","311":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of NF-kappaB, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a NF-kappaB reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) enhanced TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, and a CK1alpha kinase dead mutant, CK1alpha (K46A), reduced NF-kappaB activation induced by TNFalpha. We subsequently demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) but not with TRADD, TRAF2, MEKK3, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or IKKgamma in mammalian cells. RIP1 is an indispensable molecule in TNFalpha\/NF-kappaB signaling. We demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with and phosphorylated RIP1 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that CK1alpha enhanced RIP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that CK1alpha is another kinase that regulates RIP1 function in NF-kappaB activation.","1100":"The p53 cofactor Strap (stress responsive activator of p300) is directly targeted by the DNA damage signalling pathway where phosphorylation by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase facilitates nuclear accumulation. Here, we show that Strap regulation reflects the coordinated interplay between different DNA damage-activated protein kinases, ATM and Chk2 (Checkpoint kinase 2), where phosphorylation by each kinase provides a distinct functional consequence on the activity of Strap. ATM phosphorylation prompts nuclear accumulation, which we show occurs by impeding nuclear export, whereas Chk2 phosphorylation augments protein stability once Strap has attained a nuclear location. These results highlight the various functional roles undertaken by the DNA damage signalling kinases in Strap control and, more generally, shed light on the pathways that contribute to the regulation of the p53 response.","530":"The p53 tumor suppressor is activated in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Transactivation of p53 target genes dictates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or induction of apoptosis; however, a molecular mechanism responsible for these distinct functions remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of p53 on Ser(46) was associated with induction of p53AIP1 expression, resulting in the commitment of the cell fate into apoptotic cell death. Moreover, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, p53DINP1 was expressed and recruited a kinase(s) to p53 that specifically phosphorylated Ser(46). Here, we show that the pro-apoptotic kinase, protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta), is involved in phosphorylation of p53 on Ser(46). PKCdelta-mediated phosphorylation is required for the interaction of PKCdelta with p53. The results also demonstrate that p53DINP1 associates with PKCdelta upon exposure to genotoxic agents. Consistent with these results, PKCdelta potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis by Ser(46) phosphorylation in response to genotoxic stress. These findings indicate that PKCdelta regulates p53 to induce apoptotic cell death in the cellular response to DNA damage.","873":"The enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the control of several metabolic enzymes and transcription factors in response to extracellular signals. In the past, the enzyme has been considered to be a protein Ser\/Thr kinase although it was recently reported to contain Tyr(P) (Hughes, K., Nikolakaki, E., Plyte, S. E., Totty, N. F., and Woodgett, J. R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 803-808). A cDNA encoding rabbit skeletal muscle GSK-3 beta was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as an active protein kinase, with apparent M(r) 46,000, capable of phosphorylating several known GSK-3 substrates. Recombinant GSK-3 beta autophosphorylated on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues although the enzyme already contained Tyr(P) as judged by its recognition by anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. The net result of the autophosphorylation was a 3-5-fold reduction in enzyme activity. GSK-3 alpha, purified from rabbit muscle, also underwent autophosphorylation but only on Ser and Thr residues. In this case, the autophosphorylation stabilized the enzyme activity compared with the control lacking ATP\/Mg2+. Of several phosphatases tested, the lambda-phage phosphatase was the most effective in dephosphorylating at Ser and Thr residues but did not dephosphorylate at Tyr residues. The action of the lambda-phosphatase caused a reactivation of GSK-3 beta to approximately 80% of the starting activity. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B was able to dephosphorylate at Tyr residues leading to a reduction in enzyme activity. A truncated form of GSK-3 beta, apparent M(r) 40,000, had a significantly higher specific activity, was defective in autophosphorylation, and was not inactivated in the autophosphorylation reaction. We conclude that GSK-3 beta is a dual specificity protein kinase in the same sense as the mitogen-activated protein kinase\/ERK family of enzymes. Phosphorylation at different residues differentially controls enzyme activity, Ser\/Thr phosphorylation causing inactivation and Tyr phosphorylation resulting in increased activity.","148":"As a critical target for cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (pRb) controls early cell cycle progression. We report here a new type of regulation that influences Cdk recognition and phosphorylation of substrate proteins, mediated through the targeted methylation of a critical lysine residue in the Cdk substrate recognition site. In pRb, lysine (K) 810 represents the essential and conserved basic residue (SPXK) required for cyclin\/Cdk recognition and phosphorylation. Methylation of K810 by the methyltransferase Set7\/9 impedes binding of Cdk and thereby prevents subsequent phosphorylation of the associated serine (S) residue, retaining pRb in the hypophosphorylated growth-suppressing state. Methylation of K810 is under DNA damage control, and methylated K810 impacts on phosphorylation at sites throughout the pRb protein. Set7\/9 is required for efficient cell cycle arrest, and significantly, a mutant derivative of pRb that cannot be methylated at K810 exhibits compromised cell cycle arrest. Thus, the regulation of phosphorylation by Cdks reflects the combined interplay with methylation events, and more generally the targeted methylation of a lysine residue within a Cdk-consensus site in pRb represents an important point of control in cell cycle progression.","183":"PTP1B is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates insulin sensitivity by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor. Akt is a ser\/thr kinase effector of insulin signaling that phosphorylates substrates at the consensus motif RXRXXS\/T. Interestingly, PTP1B contains this motif (RYRDVS(50)), and wild-type PTP1B (but not mutants with substitutions for Ser(50)) was significantly phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. To determine whether PTP1B is a substrate for Akt in intact cells, NIH-3T3(IR) cells transfected with either wild-type PTP1B or PTP1B-S50A were labeled with [(32)P]-orthophosphate. Insulin stimulation caused a significant increase in phosphorylation of wild-type PTP1B that could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with wortmannin or cotransfection of a dominant inhibitory Akt mutant. Similar results were observed with endogenous PTP1B in untransfected HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of constitutively active Akt caused robust phosphorylation of wild-type PTP1B both in the absence and presence of insulin. By contrast, PTP1B-S50A did not undergo phosphorylation in response to insulin. We tested the functional significance of phosphorylation at Ser(50) by evaluating insulin receptor autophosphorylation in transfected Cos-7 cells. Insulin treatment caused robust receptor autophosphorylation that could be substantially reduced by coexpression of wild-type PTP1B. Similar results were obtained with coexpression of PTP1B-S50A. However, under the same conditions, PTP1B-S50D had an impaired ability to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor. Moreover, cotransfection of constitutively active Akt significantly inhibited the ability of wild-type PTP1B, but not PTP1B-S50A, to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor. We conclude that PTP1B is a novel substrate for Akt and that phosphorylation of PTP1B by Akt at Ser(50) may negatively modulate its phosphatase activity creating a positive feedback mechanism for insulin signaling.","337":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of NF-kappaB, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a NF-kappaB reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) enhanced TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, and a CK1alpha kinase dead mutant, CK1alpha (K46A), reduced NF-kappaB activation induced by TNFalpha.

Finally, we showed that CK1alpha enhanced RIP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that CK1alpha is another kinase that regulates RIP1 function in NF-kappaB activation.","1265":"In an effort to clone novel tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the epidermal growth factor receptor, we have initiated an approach coupling affinity purification using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to mass spectrometry-based identification. Here, we report the identification of a signaling molecule containing a Src homology 3 domain as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This molecule is 55% identical to a previously isolated molecule designated signal transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) that was identified as an interleukin (IL)-2-induced phosphoprotein and is therefore designated STAM2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2 is induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor as well as by cytokines like IL-3. Several of the deletion mutants tested except the one containing only the amino-terminal region underwent tyrosine phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation, implying that STAM2 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues. STAM2 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of STAM2 with Jak1 or Jak2 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase, Etk, resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to epidermal growth factor receptor-induced phosphorylation, this required the ITAM domain since mutants lacking this region did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, overexpression of wild type STAM2 led to an increase in IL-2-mediated induction of c-Myc promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling.","354":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) first discovered as the constitutively active nucleophosmin-ALK oncoprotein in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). Full-length ALK has a critical role in normal development and differentiation. Activated full-length ALK also is found in different malignant cancers. Nevertheless, the ligand to activate ALK remained unknown until recently, when ALK was proposed to be the physiological receptor of the cytokine pleiotrophin (PTN, Ptn). However, earlier studies had demonstrated that receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) beta\/zeta is a physiological PTN receptor. We now demonstrate that phosphorylation of ALK in PTN-stimulated cells is mediated through the PTN\/RPTPbeta\/zeta signaling pathway. ALK is phosphorylated independently of a direct interaction of PTN with ALK. The data thus support a unique model of ALK activation. In cells not stimulated by PTN, RPTPbeta\/zeta dephosphorylates ALK at the site(s) in ALK that is undergoing autophosphorylation through autoactivation. In contrast, when RPTPbeta\/zeta is inactivated in PTN-stimulated cells, the sites that are autophosphorylated in ALK no longer can be dephosphorylated by RPTPbeta\/zeta; thus, autoactivation and tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK rapidly increase. The data indicate that the PTN\/RPTPbeta\/zeta signaling pathway is a critical regulator of the steady state levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ALK; the data support the conclusion that ALK phosphorylation and activation in PTN-stimulated cells are increased through a unique \"alternative mechanism of RTK activation.\"","1005":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including MAGI-1\/2\/3, hDlg, and MAST205. Here we identified novel PTEN-binding PDZ domains within the MAST205-related proteins, syntrophin-associated serine\/threonine kinase and MAST3, characterized the regions of PTEN involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on PTEN of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of PTEN do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of PTEN (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205. Binding of PTEN to the PDZ-2 domain from MAGI-2 increased PTEN protein stability. Furthermore, binding of PTEN to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated PTEN phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of PTEN in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes PTEN and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","314":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of NF-kappaB, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes.

STAM2 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of STAM2 with Jak1 or Jak2 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase, Etk, resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to epidermal growth factor receptor-induced phosphorylation, this required the ITAM domain since mutants lacking this region did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, overexpression of wild type STAM2 led to an increase in IL-2-mediated induction of c-Myc promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling.","21":"In cell lines from advanced lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, endogenous tensin-3 contributes to cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenesis. Although SH2 domains have not been reported previously to be phosphorylated, the tensin-3 SH2 domain is a physiologic substrate for Src. Tyrosines in the SH2 domain contribute to the biological activity of tensin-3, and phosphorylation of these tyrosines can regulate ligand binding. In a mouse breast cancer model, tensin-3 tyrosines are phosphorylated in a Src-associated manner in primary tumors, and experimental metastases induced by tumor-derived cell lines depend on endogenous tensin-3. Thus, tensin-3 is implicated as an oncoprotein regulated by Src and possessing an SH2 domain with a previously undescribed mechanism for the regulation of ligand binding.","179":"The centrosome modulates spindle formation and plays a critical role in guiding proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Centrosome aberrations, frequently seen in human tumors, may cause abnormal chromosome segregation and contribute to malignant transformation. To explore the components of the centrosomes, we previously identified a novel centrosomal protein called Su48. To further characterize the Su48-containing protein ensemble in the centrosome, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and isolated a number of Su48-interacting molecules, including the centrosomal protein Nde1. Here, we demonstrate that Su48 can associate with Nde1. Moreover, we found that Nde1 is subjected to phosphorylation in vivo. In particular, we identified six putative Cdc2 phosphorylation sites in Nde1 and found that alteration of these sites diminishes phosphorylation by Cdc2 in vitro and affects the stability of Su48-Nde1 interactions and the centrosomal localization of Nde1. Ablation of Nde1 by gene specific small interfering RNA causes mitotic delay and cell death, coupled with a modest decrease in the incidence of the cells that harbor excessive centrosomes. Collectively, our findings indicate that Nde1 can form a protein complex with Su48 in the centrosome and plays an important role for successful mitosis.","500":"Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) induces actin reorganization and migration of endothelial cells through a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1) induces actin remodeling by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of LIMK1 by MAPKAPK-2 (MK2; a downstream kinase of p38 MAPK) represents a novel signaling pathway in VEGF-A-induced cell migration. VEGF-A induced LIMK1 activation and cofilin phosphorylation, and this was inhibited by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Although p38 phosphorylated LIMK1 at Ser-310, it failed to activate LIMK1 directly; however, MK2 activated LIMK1 by phosphorylation at Ser-323. Expression of a Ser-323-non-phosphorylatable mutant of LIMK1 suppressed VEGF-A-induced stress fiber formation and cell migration; however, expression of a Ser-323-phosphorylation-mimic mutant enhanced these processes. Knockdown of MK2 by siRNA suppressed VEGF-A-induced LIMK1 activation, stress fiber formation, and cell migration. Expression of kinase-dead LIMK1 suppressed VEGF-A-induced tubule formation. These findings suggest that MK2-mediated LIMK1 phosphorylation\/activation plays an essential role in VEGF-A-induced actin reorganization, migration, and tubule formation of endothelial cells.","588":"LAT is a linker protein essential for activation of T lymphocytes. Its rapid tyrosine-phosphorylation upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation recruits downstream signaling molecules for membrane targeting and activation. LAT is physically concentrated in cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains and is known a substrate for Syk\/Zap70 kinase. In this study, we demonstrate that LAT serves as a dual substrate for both Lck and Syk kinases. LAT phosphorylation is absent in Lck-deficient J.CaM1.6 cells and Lck is co-precipitated with LAT in pervanadate-activated Jurkat cells. Further, the in vitro kinase assay using purified Lck and LAT shows that Lck directly phosphorylates LAT. Both Lck and Syk, phosphorylate the ITAM-like motifs on LAT at Y171Y191, which is essential for induction of the interaction of LAT with downstream signaling molecules such as Grb2, PLC-gamma1 and c-Cbl, and for activation of MAPK-ERK. Collectively, our data indicate that LAT is an immediate substrate for Lck in one of the earliest events of T cell activation.","864":"Defining the links between cell division and DNA replication is essential for understanding normal cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In this report we explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Cdc6), a DNA replication initiation factor, by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) on the regulation of chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Cdc6 was highly increased, in correlation with the level of Plk1, and conversely, Cdc6 is hypophosphorylated in Plk1-depleted cells, although cyclin A- and cyclin B1-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Cdc6 and Plk1 occurs through the polo-box domain of Plk1, and Cdc6 is phosphorylated by Plk1 on T37. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Cdc6 and Plk1 colocalize to the central spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Cdc6 (Cdc6-TV) induces binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Cdc6 but not Cdc6-TV binds cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Expression of wild-type Plk1 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Cdc6 to Cdk1. Cells expressing wild-type Cdc6 display lower Cdk1 activity and higher separase activity than cells expressing Cdc6-TV. These results suggest that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc6 promotes the interaction of Cdc6 and Cdk1, leading to the attenuation of Cdk1 activity, release of separase, and subsequent anaphase progression.","485":"To gain insight into the function of human protein kinase X (PrKX), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, T54 and Smad6 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between PrKX and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between Smad6 and PrKX was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that PrKX phosphorylates Smad6 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of PrKX phosphorylation. Both PrKX and Smad6 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where PrKX levels are induced and Smad6 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of Smad6 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation Smad6 displays an increased binding to the human osteopontin, Id2, and Hex gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both Smad6 and PrKX proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.","709":"hDlg, the human homologue of the Drosophila Discs-large (Dlg) tumor suppressor protein, is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein APC and the human papillomavirus E6 transforming protein. In a two-hybrid screen, we identified a 322-aa serine\/threonine kinase that binds to the PDZ2 domain of hDlg. The mRNA for this PDZ-binding kinase, or PBK, is most abundant in placenta and absent from adult brain tissue. The protein sequence of PBK has all the characteristic protein kinase subdomains and a C-terminal PDZ-binding T\/SXV motif. In vitro, PBK binds specifically to PDZ2 of hDlg through its C-terminal T\/SXV motif. PBK and hDlg are phosphorylated at mitosis in HeLa cells, and the mitotic phosphorylation of PBK is required for its kinase activity. In vitro, cdc2\/cyclin B phosphorylates PBK. This evidence shows how PBK could link hDlg or other PDZ-containing proteins to signal transduction pathways regulating the cell cycle or cellular proliferation.","55":"Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, respectively. PTPN22 (Lyp), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of PTPN22. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using PTPN22-D195A\/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of PTPN22. These included three novel PTPN22 substrates (Vav, CD3epsilon, and valosin containing protein) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of PTPN22 (Lck and Zap70). T cell antigen receptor (TCR) zeta was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that PTPN22-D195A\/C227S interacted directly with activated Lck, Zap70, and TCRzeta, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native PTPN22 dephosphorylated Lck and Zap70 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (Lck) or Tyr-319 (Zap70). Native PTPN22 also dephosphorylated TCRzeta in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRzeta when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRzeta as a direct substrate of PTPN22.","1134":"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (SMC1, SMC3) are evolutionarily conserved chromosomal proteins that are components of the cohesin complex, necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. These proteins may also function in DNA repair. Here we report that SMC1 is a component of the DNA damage response network that functions as an effector in the ATM\/NBS1-dependent S-phase checkpoint pathway. SMC1 associates with BRCA1 and is phosphorylated in response to IR in an ATM- and NBS1-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, we established that ATM phosphorylates S957 and S966 of SMC1 in vivo. Phosphorylation of S957 and\/or S966 of SMC1 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint in response to IR. We also discovered that the phosphorylation of NBS1 by ATM is required for the phosphorylation of SMC1, establishing the role of NBS1 as an adaptor in the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 pathway. The ATM\/CHK2\/CDC25A pathway is also involved in the S-phase checkpoint activation, but this pathway is intact in NBS cells. Our results indicate that the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 pathway is a separate branch of the S-phase checkpoint pathway, distinct from the ATM\/CHK2\/CDC25A branch. Therefore, this work establishes the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 branch, and provides a molecular basis for the S-phase checkpoint defect in NBS cells.","279":"We and others previously identified NKX2-1, also known as TITF1 and TTF-1, as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinomas. Here we show that NKX2-1 induces the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), which in turn sustains a favorable balance between prosurvival PI3K-AKT and pro-apoptotic p38 signaling, in part through ROR1 kinase-dependent c-Src activation, as well as kinase activity-independent sustainment of the EGFR-ERBB3 association, ERBB3 phosphorylation, and consequential PI3K activation. Notably, ROR1 knockdown effectively inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, irrespective of their EGFR status, including those with resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Our findings thus identify ROR1 as an \"Achilles' heel\" in lung adenocarcinoma, warranting future development of therapeutic strategies for this devastating cancer.","313":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of NF-kappaB, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a NF-kappaB reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) enhanced TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, and a CK1alpha kinase dead mutant, CK1alpha (K46A), reduced NF-kappaB activation induced by TNFalpha. We subsequently demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) but not with TRADD, TRAF2, MEKK3, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or IKKgamma in mammalian cells. RIP1 is an indispensable molecule in TNFalpha\/NF-kappaB signaling. We demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with and phosphorylated RIP1 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that CK1alpha enhanced RIP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that CK1alpha is another kinase that regulates RIP1 function in NF-kappaB activation.","373":"Individuals carrying a mutation in one of the three cerebral cavernous malformation genes (CCM1\/KRIT1, CCM2, CCM3) cannot be clinically distinguished, raising the possibility that they act within common molecular pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that CCM3 (PDCD10) coprecipitates and colocalizes with CCM2. We also show that CCM3 directly binds to serine\/threonine kinase 25 (STK25, YSK1, SOK1) and the phosphatase domain of Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1, PTPN13, PTP-Bas, PTP-BL). CCM3 is phosphorylated by STK25 but not by its other Yeast-Two hybrid interactor STK24, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain of FAP-1 dephosphorylates CCM3. Finally, our experiments reveal that STK25 forms a protein complex with CCM2. Thus, our data link two proteins of unknown function, CCM3 and STK25, with CCM2, which is part of signaling pathways essential for vascular development and CCM pathogenesis.","699":"We identified the multifunctional chaperon protein p32 as a protein kinase C (PKC)-binding protein interacting with PKCalpha, PKCzeta, PKCdelta, and PKC mu. We have analyzed the interaction of PKC mu with p32 in detail, and we show here in vivo association of PKC mu, as revealed from yeast two-hybrid analysis, precipitation assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation. In SKW 6.4 cells, PKC mu is constitutively associated with p32 at mitochondrial membranes, evident from colocalization with cytochrome c. p32 interacts with PKC mu in a compartment-specific manner, as it can be coimmunoprecipitated mainly from the particulate and not from the soluble fraction, despite the presence of p32 in both fractions. Although p32 binds to the kinase domain of PKC mu, it does not serve as a substrate. Interestingly, PKC mu-p32 immunocomplexes precipitated from the particulate fraction of two distinct cell lines, SKW 6.4 and 293T, show no detectable substrate phosphorylation. In support of a kinase regulatory function of p32, addition of p32 to in vitro kinase assays blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, aldolase but not autophosphorylation of PKC mu, suggesting a steric hindrance of substrate within the kinase domain. Together, these findings identify p32 as a novel, compartment-specific regulator of PKC mu kinase activity.","550":"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand (bile acid)-dependent nuclear receptor that regulates target genes involved in every aspect of bile acid homeostasis. Upon binding of ligand, FXR recruits an array of coactivators and associated proteins, some of which have intrinsic enzymatic activity that modify histones or even components of the transcriptional complex. In this study, we show chromatin occupancy by the Set7\/9 methyltransferase at the FXR response element (FXRE) and direct methylation of FXR in vivo and in vitro at lysine 206. siRNA depletion of Set7\/9 in the Huh-7 liver cell line decreased endogenous mRNAs of the FXR target genes, the short heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump (BSEP). Mutation of the methylation site at K206 of FXR to an arginine prevented methylation by Set7\/9. A pan-methyllysine antibody recognized the wild-type FXR but not the K206R mutant form. An electromobility shift assay showed that methylation by Set7\/9 enhanced binding of FXR\/retinoic X receptor-\u03b1 to the FXRE. Interaction between hinge domain of FXR (containing K206) and Set7\/9 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, GST pull down, and mammalian two-hybrid experiments. Set7\/9 overexpression in Huh-7 cells significantly enhanced transactivation of the SHP and BSEP promoters in a ligand-dependent fashion by wild-type FXR but not the K206R mutant FXR. A Set7\/9 mutant deficient in methyltransferase activity was also not effective in increasing transactivation of the BSEP promoter. These studies demonstrate that posttranslational methylation of FXR by Set7\/9 contributes to the transcriptional activation of FXR-target genes.","228":"The kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 regulates the G1 cell cycle phase. Here, we present data indicating that the oncogenic kinase Src regulates p27 stability through phosphorylation of p27 at tyrosine 74 and tyrosine 88. Src inhibitors increase cellular p27 stability, and Src overexpression accelerates p27 proteolysis. Src-phosphorylated p27 is shown to inhibit cyclin E-Cdk2 poorly in vitro, and Src transfection reduces p27-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes. Our data indicate that phosphorylation by Src impairs the Cdk2 inhibitory action of p27 and reduces its steady-state binding to cyclin E-Cdk2 to facilitate cyclin E-Cdk2-dependent p27 proteolysis. Furthermore, we find that Src-activated breast cancer lines show reduced p27 and observe a correlation between Src activation and reduced nuclear p27 in 482 primary human breast cancers. Importantly, we report that in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines, Src inhibition can increase p27 levels and restore tamoxifen sensitivity. These data provide a new rationale for Src inhibitors in cancer therapy.","1302":"A zinc finger protein, ZPR9, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis. Here, ZPR9 was found to physically interact with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) through a disulfide linkage involving Cys(1351) and Cys(1360) of ASK1 and Cys(305) and Cys(308) of ZPR9. ASK1 directly phosphorylated ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318), suggesting that ZPR9 can act as an ASK1 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type ZPR9, but not an S314A\/T318A mutant, stimulated ASK1 kinase activity and positively regulated ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, or by increasing complex formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. ZPR9 functionally stimulated ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for ZPR9-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ZPR9 inhibited PDK1-mediated signaling through ASK1 activation. These results suggest that ZPR9 functions as a novel positive regulator of ASK1.","881":"Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an essential role in antigen receptor-initiated lymphocyte activation. Their activity is largely regulated by a negative regulatory tyrosine which is a substrate for the activating action of the CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) or, conversely, the suppressing action of the cytosolic p50csk PTK. Here we report that CD45 was phosphorylated by p50csk on two tyrosine residues, one of them identified as Tyr-1193. This residue was not phosphorylated by T-cell PTKs p56lck and p59fyn. Tyr-1193 was phosphorylated in intact T cells, and phosphorylation increased upon treatment with PTPase inhibitors, indicating that this tyrosine is a target for a constitutively active PTK. Cotransfection of CD45 and csk into COS-1 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 in the intact cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CD45 bound p56lck through the SH2 domain of the kinase. Finally, p50csk-mediated phosphorylation of CD45 caused a severalfold increase in its PTPase activity. Our results show that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 can affect its activity and association with Src family PTKs and that this phosphorylation could be mediated by p50csk. If this is also true in the intact cells, it adds a new dimension to the physiological function of p50csk in T lymphocytes.","993":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including MAGI-1\/2\/3, hDlg, and MAST205. Here we identified novel PTEN-binding PDZ domains within the MAST205-related proteins, syntrophin-associated serine\/threonine kinase and MAST3, characterized the regions of PTEN involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on PTEN of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of PTEN do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of PTEN (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205. Binding of PTEN to the PDZ-2 domain from MAGI-2 increased PTEN protein stability. Furthermore, binding of PTEN to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated PTEN phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of PTEN in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes PTEN and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","1014":"Phosphorylation of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase components p67phox and p47phox accompanies the assembly and activation of this enzyme complex. We have previously reported that activation of human monocytes with opsonized zymosan (ZOP), a potent stimulator of NADPH oxidase activity, results in the phosphorylation of p67phox and p47phox. In this study, we investigated the regulation of p67phox phosphorylation. Although protein kinase C (PKC)alpha has previously been shown to regulate NADPH oxidase activity, we found that inhibition of PKCalpha had no effect on p67phox phosphorylation. Our studies demonstrate that pretreatment of monocytes with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides specific for PKCdelta or rottlerin, a selective inhibitor for PKCdelta, inhibited the phosphorylation of p67phox in monocytes, and Go6976, a specific inhibitor for conventional PKCs, PKCalpha and PKCbeta, had no such inhibitory effect. Additional studies indicate that ZOP stimulation of monocytes induces PKCdelta and p67phox to form a complex. We also demonstrate that lysates from activated monocytes as well as PKCdelta immunoprecipitates from activated monocytes can phosphorylate p67phox in vitro and that pretreatment of monocytes with rottlerin blocked the phosphorylation in each case. We further show that recombinant PKCdelta can phosphorylate p67phox in vitro. Finally, we show that PKCdelta-deficient monocytes produce significantly less superoxide anion in response to ZOP stimulation, thus emphasizing the functional significance of the PKCdelta regulation of p67phox phosphorylation. Taken together, this is the first report to describe the requirement of PKCdelta in regulating the phosphorylation of p67phox and the related NADPH oxidase activity in primary human monocytes.","1221":"The centrosome modulates spindle formation and plays a critical role in guiding proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Centrosome aberrations, frequently seen in human tumors, may cause abnormal chromosome segregation and contribute to malignant transformation. To explore the components of the centrosomes, we previously identified a novel centrosomal protein called Su48. To further characterize the Su48-containing protein ensemble in the centrosome, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and isolated a number of Su48-interacting molecules, including the centrosomal protein Nde1. Here, we demonstrate that Su48 can associate with Nde1. Moreover, we found that Nde1 is subjected to phosphorylation in vivo. In particular, we identified six putative Cdc2 phosphorylation sites in Nde1 and found that alteration of these sites diminishes phosphorylation by Cdc2 in vitro and affects the stability of Su48-Nde1 interactions and the centrosomal localization of Nde1. Ablation of Nde1 by gene specific small interfering RNA causes mitotic delay and cell death, coupled with a modest decrease in the incidence of the cells that harbor excessive centrosomes. Collectively, our findings indicate that Nde1 can form a protein complex with Su48 in the centrosome and plays an important role for successful mitosis.","563":"HER2 overexpression in cancers causes hyperactivation of the PI 3-kinase pathway and elevated levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is strongly associated with increased metastatic potential. Here, we provide evidence that the cytokine-independent survival kinase CISK is activated downstream of the PI 3-kinase-dependent kinase PDK1 on endosomes and negatively regulates the lysosomal degradation of CXCR4. We demonstrate that CISK prevents CXCR4 degradation by inhibiting sorting of the receptor from early endosomes to lysosomes. In contrast, CISK does not interfere with ligand-induced degradation of epidermal growth factor receptors. CISK strongly interacts and colocalizes with the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4, which is important for the ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation of CXCR4. Moreover, the observed inhibition is both dependent on the interaction between CISK and AIP4 and on the activation status of CISK. Consistent with this, an activated form of CISK but not of the related kinase SGK1 phosphorylates specific sites of AIP4 in vitro. Taken together, these results reveal a critical function of CISK in specifically attenuating ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CXCR4, and provide a mechanistic link between the PI 3-kinase pathway and CXCR4 stability.","704":"We identified the multifunctional chaperon protein p32 as a protein kinase C (PKC)-binding protein interacting with PKCalpha, PKCzeta, PKCdelta, and PKC mu.

Together, these findings identify p32 as a novel, compartment-specific regulator of PKC mu kinase activity.","462":"It is thought that G(1) cyclin\/CDK mediated phosphorylation of pocket proteins from mid G(1) to mitosis is reversed via dephosphorylation in mitosis. We examined the mechanisms involved in the unexpectedly rapid dephosphorylation of the pocket proteins induced via inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) as well as direct inhibition of CDKs by flavopiridol. CHX and flavopiridol-induced dephosphorylation of pocket proteins is attributable to inactivation of D-type cyclin\/CDKs and G(1)\/S CDKs, respectively, which unmasks a phosphatase activity that targets the three pocket proteins apparently throughout the cell cycle. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors at concentrations selective for PP2A inhibition prevents CHX and flavopiridol-mediated dephosphorylation of pocket proteins in vivo. Also, ectopic expression of SV40 small t antigen, which inhibits PP2A via disruption of trimeric PP2A holoenzymes, delays CHX-induced pocket protein dephosphorylation. Moreover, dephosphorylation of p130 and p107 in cell extracts is inhibited by concentrations of okadaic acid known to inhibit PP2A, but not PP1. Finally, the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A\/C) specifically interacts with both p130 and p107 in quiescent cells as well as cells progressing throughout the cell cycle. Together, these results demonstrate that the overall phosphorylation state of pocket proteins is determined, at least in part, by a dynamic equilibrium between CDKs and PP2A, or a closely related PP2A-like enzyme. These findings have important implications, as cell cycle or checkpoint-dependent inhibition of CDK activities counteracted by an active PP2A should have imminent effects on the phosphorylation state and activities of pocket proteins.","848":"Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) monitors the structural integrity of intracellular proteins and its regulation is essential for the health and longevity of eukaryotic organisms. HSF1 also plays a role in the acute inflammatory response in the negative regulation of cytokine gene transcription. Here we show, for the first time, that HSF1 is regulated by the proinflammatory protein kinase MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2). We have shown that MK2 directly phosphorylates HSF1 and inhibits activity by decreasing its ability to bind the heat shock elements (HSE) found in the promoters of target genes encoding the HSP molecular chaperones and cytokine genes. We show that activation of HSF1 to bind HSE in hsp promoters is inhibited through the phosphorylation of a specific residue, serine 121 by MK2. A potential mechanism for MK2-induced HSF1 inactivation is suggested by the findings that phosphorylation of serine 121 enhances HSF1 binding to HSP90, a major repressor of HSF1. Dephosphorylation of serine 121 in cells exposed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs leads to HSP90 dissociation from HSF1, which then forms active DNA binding trimers.

activation of the P00533 (P00533) contributes to many human cancers by activating the Ras-MAPK pathway and other pathways. P00533 signaling is augmented by P12931-family kinases, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that human P00533 preferentially phosphorylates peptide substrates that are primed by a prior phosphorylation. Using peptides based on the sequence of the adaptor protein P29353, we show that P12931 mediates the priming phosphorylation, thus promoting subsequent phosphorylation by P00533. Importantly, the doubly phosphorylated P29353 peptide binds more tightly than singly phosphorylated peptide to the Ras activator P62993; this binding is a key step in activating the Ras-MAPK pathway. Finally, a crystal structure of P00533 in complex with a primed P29353 peptide reveals the structural basis for P00533 substrate specificity. These results provide a molecular explanation for the integration of P12931 and P00533 signaling with downstream effectors such as Ras. ","60":"The Q15831 tumour suppressor kinase phosphorylates and activates a number of protein kinases belonging to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) subfamily. We have used a modified tandem affinity purification strategy to identify proteins that interact with AMPKalpha, as well as the twelve AMPK-related kinases that are activated by Q15831. The Q9Y478 and AMPKgamma regulatory subunits were associated with AMPKalpha, but not with any of the AMPK-related kinases, explaining why AMP does not influence the activity of these enzymes. In addition, we identified novel binding partners that interacted with one or more of the AMPK subfamily enzymes, including fat O75604 (O75604), AAA-ATPase-p97, adenine nucleotide translocase, protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme and isoforms of the phospho-protein binding adaptor 14-3-3. Interestingly, the 14-3-3 isoforms bound directly to the T-loop Thr residue of QSK and P57059, after these were phosphorylated by Q15831. Consistent with this, the 14-3-3 isoforms failed to interact with non-phosphorylated QSK and P57059, in Q15831 knockout muscle or in HeLa cells in which Q15831 is not expressed. Moreover, mutation of the T-loop Thr phosphorylated by Q15831, prevented 23387;150094 from interacting with 14-3-3 in vitro. Binding of P57059, enhanced catalytic activity towards the Q53ET0 protein and the AMARA peptide, and was required for the cytoplasmic localization of P57059 and for localization of Q9Y2K2 to punctate structures within the cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this study provides the first example of 14-3-3 binding directly to the T-loop of a protein kinase and influencing its catalytic activity and cellular localization.","70":"We recently identified a novel actin cytoskeleton-associated protein Q9H204, for Q9H204. To unravel the cellular functions of Q9H204, we used a yeast two-hybrid system and identified P06241 tyrosine kinase as a specific binding partner for Q9H204. P06241 phosphorylates Q9H204 in vitro. In addition to P06241, P12931 and P06239 also interact with Q9H204. Upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody, Q9H204 is phosphorylated in the T lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cell line. Q9H204 phosphorylation is not observed in an P06239-deficient line, J.CaM1.6, indicating that P06239 is the major P12931 family kinase for phosphorylating Q9H204 in Jurkat cells. Employing site-directed mutagenesis along with in vitro kinase assays, we found that Y64 of Q9H204 is phosphorylated by P06239 creating a SH2-Grb2 binding motif. Q9H204 has also been identified as a Mediator subunit (Q9H204) in the nucleus involved in transcriptional regulation, therefore we propose that Q9H204 may serve as a multi-faceted adaptor\/scaffold to relay cellular signaling to the cytoskeleton and from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus.","1149":"P19838 (P19838)\/Q04864 transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory responses, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and development. There are increasing lines of evidence that P19838\/Q04864 activity is controlled to a great extent by its phosphorylation state. In this study, we demonstrated that Q04206 physically associated with protein phosphatase 2A (P67775) subunit A (PR65). Both the N- and C-terminal regions of Q04206 were responsible for the P67775 binding. Q04206 co-immunoprecipitated with P67775 in melanocytes in the absence of stimulation, indicating that Q04206 forms a signaling complex with P67775 in the cells. Q04206 was dephosphorylated by a purified P67775 core enzyme, a heterodimer formed by the catalytic subunit of P67775 (P67775) and PR65, in a concentration-dependent manner. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of P67775 at lower concentration, increased the basal phosphorylation of Q04206 in melanocytes and blocked the dephosphorylation of Q04206 after interleukin-1 stimulation. Interestingly, P67775 immunoprecipitated from melanocytes was able to dephosphorylate Q04206, whereas P67775 immunoprecipitated from melanoma cell lines exhibited decreased capacity to dephosphorylate Q04206 in vitro. Moreover, in melanoma cells in which I kappa B kinase activity was inhibited by sulindac to a similar level as in melanocytes, the phosphorylation state of Q04206 and the relative P19838 activity were still higher than those in normal melanocytes. These data suggest that the constitutive activation of Q04206 in melanoma cells (Yang, J., and Richmond, A. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 4901-4909) could be due, at least in part, to the deficiency of P67775, which exhibits decreased dephosphorylation of P19838\/Q04206.","878":"Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an essential role in antigen receptor-initiated lymphocyte activation. Their activity is largely regulated by a negative regulatory tyrosine which is a substrate for the activating action of the P08575 phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) or, conversely, the suppressing action of the cytosolic P41240 Q14289. Here we report that P08575 was phosphorylated by P41240 on two tyrosine residues, one of them identified as Tyr-1193. This residue was not phosphorylated by T-cell PTKs P06239 and P06241. Tyr-1193 was phosphorylated in intact T cells, and phosphorylation increased upon treatment with PTPase inhibitors, indicating that this tyrosine is a target for a constitutively active Q14289. Cotransfection of P08575 and P41240 into COS-1 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of P08575 in the intact cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated P08575 bound P06239 through the SH2 domain of the kinase. Finally, P41240-mediated phosphorylation of P08575 caused a severalfold increase in its PTPase activity. Our results show that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of P08575 can affect its activity and association with Src family PTKs and that this phosphorylation could be mediated by P41240. If this is also true in the intact cells, it adds a new dimension to the physiological function of P41240 in T lymphocytes.","790":"We performed a kinome-wide siRNA screen and identified 70 kinases altering cell migration in A549 lung cancer cells. In particular, Q15418 (Q15418) silencing increased, whereas P51812 and Q9UK32 downregulation inhibited cell motility. In a secondary collagen-based three-dimensional invasion screen, 38 of our hits cross-validated, including Q15418 and Q9UK32. In two further lung cancer cell lines, Q15418 but not Q9UK32 silencing showed identical modulation of cell motility. We therefore selected Q15418 for further investigation. Bioinformatic analysis followed by co-immunoprecipitation-based validation revealed that the actin regulators P50552 and Q8N8S7 interact with Q15418. Moreover, Q15418 phosphorylated P50552 on T278, a site regulating its binding to actin. In addition, silencing of Q15418 enhanced the metastatic potential of these cells in vivo using a zebrafish model. Finally, we investigated the relevance of this finding in human lung cancer samples. In isogenically matched tissue, Q15418 was reduced in metastatic versus primary lung cancer lesions. Moreover, patients with Q15418-negative lung tumours showed increased number of metastases. Our results suggest that the findings of our high-throughput in vitro screen can reliably identify relevant clinical targets and as a proof of principle, Q15418 may provide a biomarker for metastasis in lung cancer patients.","794":"P63241 (P63241) is a protein subject to hypusination, which is essential for its function. P63241 is also acetylated, but the role of that modification is unknown. Here, we report that acetylation regulates the subcellular localization of P63241. We identified Q92831 as the major cellular acetyltransferase of P63241, and Q9UBN7 and Q8IXJ6 as its major deacetylases. Inhibition of the deacetylases or impaired hypusination increased acetylation of P63241, leading to nuclear accumulation. As P63241 is constitutively hypusinated under physiological conditions, we suggest that reversible acetylation plays a major role in controlling the subcellular localization of P63241.","271":"Although Q9BZQ8 is highly expressed in human cancer cells, the cellular functions of Q9BZQ8 remain largely unknown. We demonstrate here that ultraviolet irradiation induces phosphorylation of Q9BZQ8 at S602 by P31749, which increases the association of Q9BZQ8 with nucleophosmin and disassociation of nucleophosmin from the Q00987 complex. This leads to the promotion of Q00987-P04637 interaction and subsequent P04637 degradation, thereby providing an antiapoptotic effect. Conversely, depletion of or deficiency in Q9BZQ8 expression promotes stabilization of P04637 with increased cell apoptosis. Our findings illustrate a pivotal role for P31749-mediated phosphorylation of Q9BZQ8 in protecting cells from genotoxic stress-induced cell apoptosis.","1126":"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (Q14683, Q9UQE7) are evolutionarily conserved chromosomal proteins that are components of the cohesin complex, necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. These proteins may also function in DNA repair. Here we report that Q14683 is a component of the DNA damage response network that functions as an effector in the Q13315\/O60934-dependent S-phase checkpoint pathway. Q14683 associates with P38398 and is phosphorylated in response to IR in an Q13315- and O60934-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, we established that Q13315 phosphorylates S957 and S966 of Q14683 in vivo. Phosphorylation of S957 and\/or S966 of Q14683 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint in response to IR. We also discovered that the phosphorylation of O60934 by Q13315 is required for the phosphorylation of Q14683, establishing the role of O60934 as an adaptor in the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 pathway. The Q13315\/O96017\/P30304 pathway is also involved in the S-phase checkpoint activation, but this pathway is intact in NBS cells. Our results indicate that the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 pathway is a separate branch of the S-phase checkpoint pathway, distinct from the Q13315\/O96017\/P30304 branch. Therefore, this work establishes the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 branch, and provides a molecular basis for the S-phase checkpoint defect in NBS cells.","1278":"In an effort to clone novel tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the P00533, we have initiated an approach coupling affinity purification using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to mass spectrometry-based identification. Here, we report the identification of a signaling molecule containing a Src homology 3 domain as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This molecule is 55% identical to a previously isolated molecule designated Q92783 (Q92783) that was identified as an interleukin (IL)-2-induced phosphoprotein and is therefore designated O75886. Tyrosine phosphorylation of O75886 is induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor as well as by cytokines like P08700. Several of the deletion mutants tested except the one containing only the amino-terminal region underwent tyrosine phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation, implying that O75886 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues. O75886 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of O75886 with P23458 or O60674 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase, P29320, resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to P00533-induced phosphorylation, this required the ITAM domain since mutants lacking this region did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, overexpression of wild type O75886 led to an increase in P60568-mediated induction of P01106 promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling.","363":"Individuals carrying a mutation in one of the three cerebral cavernous malformation genes (O00522\/O00522, Q9BSQ5, Q9BUL8) cannot be clinically distinguished, raising the possibility that they act within common molecular pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that Q9BUL8 (Q9BUL8) coprecipitates and colocalizes with Q9BSQ5. We also show that Q9BUL8 directly binds to O00506 (O00506, O00506, O00506) and the phosphatase domain of Q12923 (Q12923, Q12923, Q12923, Q12923). Q9BUL8 is phosphorylated by O00506 but not by its other Yeast-Two hybrid interactor Q9Y6E0, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain of Q12923 dephosphorylates Q9BUL8. Finally, our experiments reveal that O00506 forms a protein complex with Q9BSQ5. Thus, our data link two proteins of unknown function, Q9BUL8 and O00506, with Q9BSQ5, which is part of signaling pathways essential for vascular development and CCM pathogenesis.","846":"We address here the involvement of the Q9H2X6 (Q9H2X6)\/P04637 complex on Q00987 regulation following apoptotic DNA damage. Our results provide a plausible transcriptional (P04637-dependent) and posttranscriptional (P04637-independent) double mechanism by which Q9H2X6 accomplishes Q00987 downmodulation. First, in wtp53-carrying cells Q9H2X6-dependent P04637Ser46 phosphorylation selectively inhibits Q00987 at transcriptional level. Secondly, Q9H2X6 interacts with Q00987 in vitro and in vivo and promotes Q00987 nuclear export and proteasomal degradation, in P04637-null cellular context. This P04637-independent effect is likely mediated by Q9H2X6 catalytic activity and we found that Q9H2X6 phosphorylates Q00987 in vitro. In response to DNA damage, depletion of Q9H2X6 by RNA-interference abolishes Q00987 protein degradation. We propose that Q9H2X6 contributes to drug-induced modulation of Q00987 activity at transcriptional (through P04637Ser46 phosphorylation) and posttranscriptional (through P04637-independent subcellular re-localization and proteasomal degradation) levels.","579":"The P23588 (P23588) plays a critical role in recruiting the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. In response to insulin, P23588 is phosphorylated on Ser422 by P23443 in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Here we demonstrate that the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (Q15418) phosphorylates P23588 on the same residue. The relative contribution of the Q15418 and P23443 modules to the phosphorylation of P23588 is growth factor-dependent, and the two phosphorylation events exhibit very different kinetics. The P23443 and Q15418 proteins are members of the AGC protein kinase family, and require Q15118 phosphorylation for activation. Consistent with this requirement, phosphorylation of P23588 Ser422 is abrogated in Q15118 null embryonic stem cells. Phosphorylation of P23588 on Ser422 by Q15418 and P23443 is physiologically significant, as it increases the interaction of P23588 with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3.","380":"Here we show that 14-3-3 proteins bind to P11309 kinase-phosphorylated Ser166 and Ser186 on the human E3 ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 (Q00987), but not Q14289 (Q14289)\/Akt-phosphorylated Ser166 and Ser188. P11309-mediated phosphorylation of Ser186 blocks phosphorylation of Ser188 by Q14289, indicating potential interplay between the P11309 and Q14289 signaling pathways in regulating Q00987. In cells, expression of P11309 kinases promoted phosphorylation of Ser166 and Ser186, interaction of Q00987 with endogenous 14-3-3s and O95059(ARF), and also increased the amount of Q00987 protein by a mechanism that does not require P11309 kinase activities. The implications of these findings for regulation of the P04637 pathway, oncogenesis and drug discovery are discussed.","311":"P01375 (P01375) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of P19838, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a P19838 reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (P48729) enhanced P01375-induced P19838 activation, and a P48729 kinase dead mutant, P48729 (K46A), reduced P19838 activation induced by P01375. We subsequently demonstrated that P48729 interacted with Q13546 (Q13546) but not with Q15628, Q12933, Q99759, O15111, O14920, or Q9Y6K9 in mammalian cells. Q13546 is an indispensable molecule in P01375\/P19838 signaling. We demonstrated that P48729 interacted with and phosphorylated Q13546 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that P48729 enhanced Q13546-mediated P19838 activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that P48729 is another kinase that regulates Q13546 function in P19838 activation.","1100":"The P04637 cofactor Q8N0Z6 (Q8N0Z6) is directly targeted by the DNA damage signalling pathway where phosphorylation by Q13315) kinase facilitates nuclear accumulation. Here, we show that Q8N0Z6 regulation reflects the coordinated interplay between different DNA damage-activated protein kinases, ATM and O96017 (O96017), where phosphorylation by each kinase provides a distinct functional consequence on the activity of Q8N0Z6. ATM phosphorylation prompts nuclear accumulation, which we show occurs by impeding nuclear export, whereas O96017 phosphorylation augments protein stability once Q8N0Z6 has attained a nuclear location. These results highlight the various functional roles undertaken by the DNA damage signalling kinases in Q8N0Z6 control and, more generally, shed light on the pathways that contribute to the regulation of the P04637 response.","530":"The P04637 tumor suppressor is activated in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Transactivation of P04637 target genes dictates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or induction of apoptosis; however, a molecular mechanism responsible for these distinct functions remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of P04637 on Ser(46) was associated with induction of Q9HCN2 expression, resulting in the commitment of the cell fate into apoptotic cell death. Moreover, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, Q96A56 was expressed and recruited a kinase(s) to P04637 that specifically phosphorylated Ser(46). Here, we show that the pro-apoptotic kinase, Q05655 (Q05655), is involved in phosphorylation of P04637 on Ser(46). Q05655-mediated phosphorylation is required for the interaction of Q05655 with P04637. The results also demonstrate that Q96A56 associates with Q05655 upon exposure to genotoxic agents. Consistent with these results, Q05655 potentiates P04637-dependent apoptosis by Ser(46) phosphorylation in response to genotoxic stress. These findings indicate that Q05655 regulates P04637 to induce apoptotic cell death in the cellular response to DNA damage.","873":"The enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the control of several metabolic enzymes and transcription factors in response to extracellular signals. In the past, the enzyme has been considered to be a protein Ser\/Thr kinase although it was recently reported to contain Tyr(P) (Hughes, K., Nikolakaki, E., Plyte, S. E., Totty, N. F., and Woodgett, J. R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 803-808). A cDNA encoding rabbit skeletal muscle P49841 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as an active protein kinase, with apparent M(r) 46,000, capable of phosphorylating several known GSK-3 substrates. Recombinant P49841 autophosphorylated on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues although the enzyme already contained Tyr(P) as judged by its recognition by anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. The net result of the autophosphorylation was a 3-5-fold reduction in enzyme activity. P49840, purified from rabbit muscle, also underwent autophosphorylation but only on Ser and Thr residues. In this case, the autophosphorylation stabilized the enzyme activity compared with the control lacking ATP\/Mg2+. Of several phosphatases tested, the lambda-phage phosphatase was the most effective in dephosphorylating at Ser and Thr residues but did not dephosphorylate at Tyr residues. The action of the lambda-phosphatase caused a reactivation of P49841 to approximately 80% of the starting activity. The protein tyrosine phosphatase P18031 was able to dephosphorylate at Tyr residues leading to a reduction in enzyme activity. A truncated form of P49841, apparent M(r) 40,000, had a significantly higher specific activity, was defective in autophosphorylation, and was not inactivated in the autophosphorylation reaction. We conclude that P49841 is a dual specificity protein kinase in the same sense as the mitogen-activated protein kinase\/ERK family of enzymes. Phosphorylation at different residues differentially controls enzyme activity, Ser\/Thr phosphorylation causing inactivation and Tyr phosphorylation resulting in increased activity.","148":"As a critical target for P12004-dependent kinases (Cdks), the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (P06400) controls early cell cycle progression. We report here a new type of regulation that influences Cdk recognition and phosphorylation of substrate proteins, mediated through the targeted methylation of a critical lysine residue in the Cdk substrate recognition site. In P06400, lysine (K) 810 represents the essential and conserved basic residue (SPXK) required for P12004\/Cdk recognition and phosphorylation. Methylation of K810 by the methyltransferase Q8WTS6 impedes binding of Cdk and thereby prevents subsequent phosphorylation of the associated serine (S) residue, retaining P06400 in the hypophosphorylated growth-suppressing state. Methylation of K810 is under DNA damage control, and methylated K810 impacts on phosphorylation at sites throughout the P06400 protein. Q8WTS6 is required for efficient cell cycle arrest, and significantly, a mutant derivative of P06400 that cannot be methylated at K810 exhibits compromised cell cycle arrest. Thus, the regulation of phosphorylation by Cdks reflects the combined interplay with methylation events, and more generally the targeted methylation of a lysine residue within a Cdk-consensus site in P06400 represents an important point of control in cell cycle progression.","183":"P18031 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates insulin sensitivity by dephosphorylating the P06213. P31749 is a ser\/thr kinase effector of insulin signaling that phosphorylates substrates at the consensus motif RXRXXS\/T. Interestingly, P18031 contains this motif (RYRDVS(50)), and wild-type P18031 (but not mutants with substitutions for Ser(50)) was significantly phosphorylated by P31749 in vitro. To determine whether P18031 is a substrate for P31749 in intact cells, NIH-3T3(IR) cells transfected with either wild-type P18031 or P18031-S50A were labeled with [(32)P]-orthophosphate. Insulin stimulation caused a significant increase in phosphorylation of wild-type P18031 that could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with wortmannin or cotransfection of a dominant inhibitory P31749 mutant. Similar results were observed with endogenous P18031 in untransfected HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of constitutively active P31749 caused robust phosphorylation of wild-type P18031 both in the absence and presence of insulin. By contrast, P18031-S50A did not undergo phosphorylation in response to insulin. We tested the functional significance of phosphorylation at Ser(50) by evaluating P06213 autophosphorylation in transfected Cos-7 cells. Insulin treatment caused robust receptor autophosphorylation that could be substantially reduced by coexpression of wild-type P18031. Similar results were obtained with coexpression of P18031-S50A. However, under the same conditions, P18031-S50D had an impaired ability to dephosphorylate the P06213. Moreover, cotransfection of constitutively active P31749 significantly inhibited the ability of wild-type P18031, but not P18031-S50A, to dephosphorylate the P06213. We conclude that P18031 is a novel substrate for P31749 and that phosphorylation of P18031 by P31749 at Ser(50) may negatively modulate its phosphatase activity creating a positive feedback mechanism for insulin signaling.","337":"P01375 (P01375) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of P19838, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a P19838 reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (P48729) enhanced P01375-induced P19838 activation, and a P48729 kinase dead mutant, P48729 (K46A), reduced P19838 activation induced by P01375. We subsequently demonstrated that P48729 interacted with Q13546 (Q13546) but not with Q15628, Q12933, Q99759, O15111, O14920, or Q9Y6K9 in mammalian cells. Q13546 is an indispensable molecule in P01375\/P19838 signaling. We demonstrated that P48729 interacted with and phosphorylated Q13546 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that P48729 enhanced Q13546-mediated P19838 activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that P48729 is another kinase that regulates Q13546 function in P19838 activation.","1265":"In an effort to clone novel tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the P00533, we have initiated an approach coupling affinity purification using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to mass spectrometry-based identification. Here, we report the identification of a signaling molecule containing a Src homology 3 domain as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This molecule is 55% identical to a previously isolated molecule designated Q92783 (Q92783) that was identified as an interleukin (IL)-2-induced phosphoprotein and is therefore designated O75886. Tyrosine phosphorylation of O75886 is induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor as well as by cytokines like P08700. Several of the deletion mutants tested except the one containing only the amino-terminal region underwent tyrosine phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation, implying that O75886 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues. O75886 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of O75886 with P23458 or O60674 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase, P29320, resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to P00533-induced phosphorylation, this required the ITAM domain since mutants lacking this region did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, overexpression of wild type O75886 led to an increase in P60568-mediated induction of P01106 promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling.","354":"Q9UM73 (Q9UM73) is a P07949 (P07949) first discovered as the constitutively active nucleophosmin-Q9UM73 oncoprotein in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). Full-length Q9UM73 has a critical role in normal development and differentiation. Activated full-length Q9UM73 also is found in different malignant cancers. Nevertheless, the ligand to activate Q9UM73 remained unknown until recently, when Q9UM73 was proposed to be the physiological receptor of the cytokine P21246 (P21246, P21246). However, earlier studies had demonstrated that O14522 (RPTP) beta\/zeta is a physiological P21246 receptor. We now demonstrate that phosphorylation of Q9UM73 in P21246-stimulated cells is mediated through the P21246\/P23471\/zeta signaling pathway. Q9UM73 is phosphorylated independently of a direct interaction of P21246 with Q9UM73. The data thus support a unique model of Q9UM73 activation. In cells not stimulated by P21246, P23471\/zeta dephosphorylates Q9UM73 at the site(s) in Q9UM73 that is undergoing autophosphorylation through autoactivation. In contrast, when P23471\/zeta is inactivated in P21246-stimulated cells, the sites that are autophosphorylated in Q9UM73 no longer can be dephosphorylated by P23471\/zeta; thus, autoactivation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Q9UM73 rapidly increase. The data indicate that the P21246\/P23471\/zeta signaling pathway is a critical regulator of the steady state levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Q9UM73; the data support the conclusion that Q9UM73 phosphorylation and activation in P21246-stimulated cells are increased through a unique \"alternative mechanism of P07949 activation.\"","1005":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase P60484 is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including 9223;9863;260425, Q12959, and Q6P0Q8. Here we identified novel P60484-binding PDZ domains within the Q6P0Q8-related proteins, Q9Y2H9 and O60307, characterized the regions of P60484 involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on P60484 of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of P60484 mutations, as well as P60484 chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein P56180, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of P60484 do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of P60484 (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from Q86UL8, Q12959, and Q6P0Q8. Binding of P60484 to the PDZ-2 domain from Q86UL8 increased P60484 protein stability. Furthermore, binding of P60484 to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated P60484 phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of P60484 in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes P60484 and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","314":"P01375 (P01375) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of P19838, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes.

Although SH2 domains have not been reported previously to be phosphorylated, the Q68CZ2 SH2 domain is a physiologic substrate for P12931. Tyrosines in the SH2 domain contribute to the biological activity of Q68CZ2, and phosphorylation of these tyrosines can regulate ligand binding. In a mouse breast cancer model, Q68CZ2 tyrosines are phosphorylated in a P12931-associated manner in primary tumors, and experimental metastases induced by tumor-derived cell lines depend on endogenous Q68CZ2. Thus, Q68CZ2 is implicated as an oncoprotein regulated by P12931 and possessing an SH2 domain with a previously undescribed mechanism for the regulation of ligand binding.","179":"The centrosome modulates spindle formation and plays a critical role in guiding proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Centrosome aberrations, frequently seen in human tumors, may cause abnormal chromosome segregation and contribute to malignant transformation. To explore the components of the centrosomes, we previously identified a novel centrosomal protein called Q70YC4. To further characterize the Q70YC4-containing protein ensemble in the centrosome, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and isolated a number of Q70YC4-interacting molecules, including the centrosomal protein Q9NXR1. Here, we demonstrate that Q70YC4 can associate with Q9NXR1. Moreover, we found that Q9NXR1 is subjected to phosphorylation in vivo. In particular, we identified six putative P06493 phosphorylation sites in Q9NXR1 and found that alteration of these sites diminishes phosphorylation by P06493 in vitro and affects the stability of Q70YC4-Q9NXR1 interactions and the centrosomal localization of Q9NXR1. Ablation of Q9NXR1 by gene specific small interfering RNA causes mitotic delay and cell death, coupled with a modest decrease in the incidence of the cells that harbor excessive centrosomes. Collectively, our findings indicate that Q9NXR1 can form a protein complex with Q70YC4 in the centrosome and plays an important role for successful mitosis.","500":"P15692 (P15692) induces actin reorganization and migration of endothelial cells through a Q16539 (MAPK) pathway. P53667 (P53667) induces actin remodeling by phosphorylating and inactivating P23528, an actin-depolymerizing factor. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of P53667 by P49137 (P49137; a downstream kinase of Q16539 MAPK) represents a novel signaling pathway in P15692-induced cell migration. P15692 induced P53667 activation and P23528 phosphorylation, and this was inhibited by the Q16539 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Although Q16539 phosphorylated P53667 at Ser-310, it failed to activate P53667 directly; however, P49137 activated P53667 by phosphorylation at Ser-323. Expression of a Ser-323-non-phosphorylatable mutant of P53667 suppressed P15692-induced stress fiber formation and cell migration; however, expression of a Ser-323-phosphorylation-mimic mutant enhanced these processes. Knockdown of P49137 by siRNA suppressed P15692-induced P53667 activation, stress fiber formation, and cell migration. Expression of kinase-dead P53667 suppressed P15692-induced tubule formation. These findings suggest that P49137-mediated P53667 phosphorylation\/activation plays an essential role in P15692-induced actin reorganization, migration, and tubule formation of endothelial cells.","588":"O43561 is a linker protein essential for activation of T lymphocytes. Its rapid tyrosine-phosphorylation upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation recruits downstream signaling molecules for membrane targeting and activation. O43561 is physically concentrated in cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains and is known a substrate for P43405\/P43403 kinase. In this study, we demonstrate that O43561 serves as a dual substrate for both P06239 and P43405 kinases. O43561 phosphorylation is absent in P06239-deficient J.CaM1.6 cells and P06239 is co-precipitated with O43561 in pervanadate-activated Jurkat cells. Further, the in vitro kinase assay using purified P06239 and O43561 shows that P06239 directly phosphorylates O43561. Both P06239 and P43405, phosphorylate the ITAM-like motifs on O43561 at Y171Y191, which is essential for induction of the interaction of O43561 with downstream signaling molecules such as P62993, P19174 and P22681, and for activation of MAPK-ERK. Collectively, our data indicate that O43561 is an immediate substrate for P06239 in one of the earliest events of T cell activation.","864":"Defining the links between cell division and DNA replication is essential for understanding normal cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In this report we explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Q99741), a DNA replication initiation factor, by P53350 (P53350) on the regulation of chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Q99741 was highly increased, in correlation with the level of P53350, and conversely, Q99741 is hypophosphorylated in P53350-depleted cells, although P20248- and P14635-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Q99741 and P53350 occurs through the polo-box domain of P53350, and Q99741 is phosphorylated by P53350 on T37. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Q99741 and P53350 colocalize to the central spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Q99741 (Q99741) induces binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Q99741 but not Q99741 binds P06493 (P06493). Expression of wild-type P53350 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Q99741 to P06493. Cells expressing wild-type Q99741 display lower P06493 activity and higher Q14674 activity than cells expressing Q99741. These results suggest that P53350-mediated phosphorylation of Q99741 promotes the interaction of Q99741 and P06493, leading to the attenuation of P06493 activity, release of Q14674, and subsequent anaphase progression.","485":"To gain insight into the function of human P51817 (P51817), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, Q92917 and O43541 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between P51817 and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between O43541 and P51817 was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that P51817 phosphorylates O43541 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of P51817 phosphorylation. Both P51817 and O43541 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where P51817 levels are induced and O43541 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of O43541 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation O43541 displays an increased binding to the human P10451, Q02363, and Q03014 gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both O43541 and P51817 proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.","709":"Q12959, the human homologue of the Drosophila Discs-large (Q12959) tumor suppressor protein, is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein APC and the human papillomavirus E6 transforming protein. In a two-hybrid screen, we identified a 322-aa serine\/threonine kinase that binds to the PDZ2 domain of Q12959. The mRNA for this Q96KB5, or Q96KB5, is most abundant in placenta and absent from adult brain tissue. The protein sequence of Q96KB5 has all the characteristic protein kinase subdomains and a C-terminal PDZ-binding T\/SXV motif. In vitro, Q96KB5 binds specifically to PDZ2 of Q12959 through its C-terminal T\/SXV motif. Q96KB5 and Q12959 are phosphorylated at mitosis in HeLa cells, and the mitotic phosphorylation of Q96KB5 is required for its kinase activity. In vitro, P06493\/cyclin B phosphorylates Q96KB5. This evidence shows how Q96KB5 could link Q12959 or other PDZ-containing proteins to signal transduction pathways regulating the cell cycle or cellular proliferation.","55":"Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Q9Y2R2 (Q9Y2R2), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of Q9Y2R2. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of Q9Y2R2. These included three novel Q9Y2R2 substrates (P15498, P07766, and P55072) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of Q9Y2R2 (P06239 and P43403). 6962 (6962) zeta was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S interacted directly with activated P06239, P43403, and TCRzeta, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native Q9Y2R2 dephosphorylated P06239 and P43403 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (P06239) or Tyr-319 (P43403). Native Q9Y2R2 also dephosphorylated TCRzeta in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRzeta when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRzeta as a direct substrate of Q9Y2R2.","1134":"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (Q14683, Q9UQE7) are evolutionarily conserved chromosomal proteins that are components of the cohesin complex, necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. These proteins may also function in DNA repair. Here we report that Q14683 is a component of the DNA damage response network that functions as an effector in the Q13315\/O60934-dependent S-phase checkpoint pathway. Q14683 associates with P38398 and is phosphorylated in response to IR in an Q13315- and O60934-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, we established that Q13315 phosphorylates S957 and S966 of Q14683 in vivo. Phosphorylation of S957 and\/or S966 of Q14683 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint in response to IR. We also discovered that the phosphorylation of O60934 by Q13315 is required for the phosphorylation of Q14683, establishing the role of O60934 as an adaptor in the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 pathway. The Q13315\/O96017\/P30304 pathway is also involved in the S-phase checkpoint activation, but this pathway is intact in NBS cells. Our results indicate that the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 pathway is a separate branch of the S-phase checkpoint pathway, distinct from the Q13315\/O96017\/P30304 branch. Therefore, this work establishes the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 branch, and provides a molecular basis for the S-phase checkpoint defect in NBS cells.","279":"We and others previously identified P43699, also known as P43699 and Q15361, as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinomas. Here we show that P43699 induces the expression of the Q01973 (Q01973), which in turn sustains a favorable balance between prosurvival PI3K-AKT and pro-apoptotic P28482 signaling, in part through Q01973 kinase-dependent P12931 activation, as well as kinase activity-independent sustainment of the P00533-P21860 association, P21860 phosphorylation, and consequential PI3K activation. Notably, Q01973 knockdown effectively inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, irrespective of their P00533 status, including those with resistance to the P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Our findings thus identify Q01973 as an \"Achilles' heel\" in lung adenocarcinoma, warranting future development of therapeutic strategies for this devastating cancer.","313":"P01375 (P01375) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of P19838, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a P19838 reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (P48729) enhanced P01375-induced P19838 activation, and a P48729 kinase dead mutant, P48729 (K46A), reduced P19838 activation induced by P01375. We subsequently demonstrated that P48729 interacted with Q13546 (Q13546) but not with Q15628, Q12933, Q99759, O15111, O14920, or Q9Y6K9 in mammalian cells. Q13546 is an indispensable molecule in P01375\/P19838 signaling. We demonstrated that P48729 interacted with and phosphorylated Q13546 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that P48729 enhanced Q13546-mediated P19838 activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that P48729 is another kinase that regulates Q13546 function in P19838 activation.","373":"Individuals carrying a mutation in one of the three cerebral cavernous malformation genes (O00522\/O00522, Q9BSQ5, Q9BUL8) cannot be clinically distinguished, raising the possibility that they act within common molecular pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that Q9BUL8 (Q9BUL8) coprecipitates and colocalizes with Q9BSQ5. We also show that Q9BUL8 directly binds to O00506 (O00506, O00506, O00506) and the phosphatase domain of Q12923 (Q12923, Q12923, Q12923, Q12923). Q9BUL8 is phosphorylated by O00506 but not by its other Yeast-Two hybrid interactor Q9Y6E0, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain of Q12923 dephosphorylates Q9BUL8. Finally, our experiments reveal that O00506 forms a protein complex with Q9BSQ5. Thus, our data link two proteins of unknown function, Q9BUL8 and O00506, with Q9BSQ5, which is part of signaling pathways essential for vascular development and CCM pathogenesis.","699":"We identified the multifunctional chaperon protein Q07021 as a protein kinase C (PKC)-binding protein interacting with P17252, Q05513, Q05655, and Q15139. We have analyzed the interaction of Q15139 with Q07021 in detail, and we show here in vivo association of Q15139, as revealed from yeast two-hybrid analysis, precipitation assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation. In SKW 6.4 cells, Q15139 is constitutively associated with Q07021 at mitochondrial membranes, evident from colocalization with P99999. Q07021 interacts with Q15139 in a compartment-specific manner, as it can be coimmunoprecipitated mainly from the particulate and not from the soluble fraction, despite the presence of Q07021 in both fractions. Although Q07021 binds to the kinase domain of Q15139, it does not serve as a substrate. Interestingly, Q15139-Q07021 immunocomplexes precipitated from the particulate fraction of two distinct cell lines, SKW 6.4 and 293T, show no detectable substrate phosphorylation. In support of a kinase regulatory function of Q07021, addition of Q07021 to in vitro kinase assays blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, aldolase but not autophosphorylation of Q15139, suggesting a steric hindrance of substrate within the kinase domain. Together, these findings identify Q07021 as a novel, compartment-specific regulator of Q15139 kinase activity.","550":"The Q96RI1 (Q96RI1) is a ligand (bile acid)-dependent nuclear receptor that regulates target genes involved in every aspect of bile acid homeostasis. Upon binding of ligand, Q96RI1 recruits an array of coactivators and associated proteins, some of which have intrinsic enzymatic activity that modify histones or even components of the transcriptional complex. In this study, we show chromatin occupancy by the Q8WTS6 methyltransferase at the Q96RI1 response element (FXRE) and direct methylation of Q96RI1 in vivo and in vitro at lysine 206. siRNA depletion of Q8WTS6 in the 284424 liver cell line decreased endogenous mRNAs of the Q96RI1 target genes, the short heterodimer partner (Q15466) and O95342 (O95342). Mutation of the methylation site at K206 of Q96RI1 to an arginine prevented methylation by Q8WTS6. A pan-methyllysine antibody recognized the wild-type Q96RI1 but not the K206R mutant form. An electromobility shift assay showed that methylation by Q8WTS6 enhanced binding of Q96RI1\/retinoic X receptor- to the FXRE. Interaction between hinge domain of Q96RI1 (containing K206) and Q8WTS6 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, GST pull down, and mammalian two-hybrid experiments. Q8WTS6 overexpression in 284424 cells significantly enhanced transactivation of the Q15466 and O95342 promoters in a ligand-dependent fashion by wild-type Q96RI1 but not the K206R mutant Q96RI1. A Q8WTS6 mutant deficient in methyltransferase activity was also not effective in increasing transactivation of the O95342 promoter. These studies demonstrate that posttranslational methylation of Q96RI1 by Q8WTS6 contributes to the transcriptional activation of Q96RI1-target genes.","228":"The kinase inhibitor P46527 regulates the G1 cell cycle phase. Here, we present data indicating that the oncogenic kinase P12931 regulates O60232 stability through phosphorylation of O60232 at tyrosine 74 and tyrosine 88. P12931 inhibitors increase cellular O60232 stability, and P12931 overexpression accelerates O60232 proteolysis. P12931-phosphorylated O60232 is shown to inhibit cyclin E-P24941 poorly in vitro, and P12931 transfection reduces O60232-cyclin E-P24941 complexes. Our data indicate that phosphorylation by P12931 impairs the P24941 inhibitory action of O60232 and reduces its steady-state binding to cyclin E-P24941 to facilitate cyclin E-P24941-dependent O60232 proteolysis. Furthermore, we find that P12931-activated breast cancer lines show reduced O60232 and observe a correlation between P12931 activation and reduced nuclear O60232 in 482 primary human breast cancers. Importantly, we report that in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines, P12931 inhibition can increase O60232 levels and restore tamoxifen sensitivity. These data provide a new rationale for P12931 inhibitors in cancer therapy.","1302":"A zinc finger protein, Q969S3, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis. Here, Q969S3 was found to physically interact with Q99683 (Q99683) through a disulfide linkage involving Cys(1351) and Cys(1360) of Q99683 and Cys(305) and Cys(308) of Q969S3. Q99683 directly phosphorylated Q969S3 at Ser(314) and Thr(318), suggesting that Q969S3 can act as an Q99683 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type Q969S3, but not an S314A\/T318A mutant, stimulated Q99683 kinase activity and positively regulated Q99683-mediated signaling to both JNK and Q16539 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between Q99683 and its negative regulators, Q08AM6, or by increasing complex formation between Q99683 and its substrate P46734. Q969S3 functionally stimulated Q99683-induced P01100 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Q99683-mediated phosphorylation of Q969S3 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for Q969S3-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Q969S3 inhibited Q15118-mediated signaling through Q99683 activation. These results suggest that Q969S3 functions as a novel positive regulator of Q99683.","881":"Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an essential role in antigen receptor-initiated lymphocyte activation. Their activity is largely regulated by a negative regulatory tyrosine which is a substrate for the activating action of the P08575 phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) or, conversely, the suppressing action of the cytosolic P41240 Q14289. Here we report that P08575 was phosphorylated by P41240 on two tyrosine residues, one of them identified as Tyr-1193. This residue was not phosphorylated by T-cell PTKs P06239 and P06241. Tyr-1193 was phosphorylated in intact T cells, and phosphorylation increased upon treatment with PTPase inhibitors, indicating that this tyrosine is a target for a constitutively active Q14289. Cotransfection of P08575 and P41240 into COS-1 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of P08575 in the intact cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated P08575 bound P06239 through the SH2 domain of the kinase. Finally, P41240-mediated phosphorylation of P08575 caused a severalfold increase in its PTPase activity. Our results show that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of P08575 can affect its activity and association with Src family PTKs and that this phosphorylation could be mediated by P41240. If this is also true in the intact cells, it adds a new dimension to the physiological function of P41240 in T lymphocytes.","993":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase P60484 is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including 9223;9863;260425, Q12959, and Q6P0Q8. Here we identified novel P60484-binding PDZ domains within the Q6P0Q8-related proteins, Q9Y2H9 and O60307, characterized the regions of P60484 involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on P60484 of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of P60484 mutations, as well as P60484 chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein P56180, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of P60484 do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of P60484 (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from Q86UL8, Q12959, and Q6P0Q8. Binding of P60484 to the PDZ-2 domain from Q86UL8 increased P60484 protein stability. Furthermore, binding of P60484 to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated P60484 phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of P60484 in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes P60484 and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","1014":"Phosphorylation of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase components P19878 and P14598 accompanies the assembly and activation of this enzyme complex. We have previously reported that activation of human monocytes with opsonized zymosan (ZOP), a potent stimulator of NADPH oxidase activity, results in the phosphorylation of P19878 and P14598. In this study, we investigated the regulation of P19878 phosphorylation. Although protein kinase C (P17252 has previously been shown to regulate NADPH oxidase activity, we found that inhibition of P17252 had no effect on P19878 phosphorylation. Our studies demonstrate that pretreatment of monocytes with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides specific for Q05655 or rottlerin, a selective inhibitor for Q05655, inhibited the phosphorylation of P19878 in monocytes, and Go6976, a specific inhibitor for conventional PKCs, P17252 and P05771, had no such inhibitory effect. Additional studies indicate that ZOP stimulation of monocytes induces Q05655 and P19878 to form a complex. We also demonstrate that lysates from activated monocytes as well as Q05655 immunoprecipitates from activated monocytes can phosphorylate P20138phox in vitro and that pretreatment of monocytes with rottlerin blocked the phosphorylation in each case. We further show that recombinant Q05655 can phosphorylate P20138phox in vitro. Finally, we show that Q05655-deficient monocytes produce significantly less superoxide anion in response to ZOP stimulation, thus emphasizing the functional significance of the Q05655 regulation of P19878 phosphorylation. Taken together, this is the first report to describe the requirement of Q05655 in regulating the phosphorylation of P19878 and the related NADPH oxidase activity in primary human monocytes.","1221":"The centrosome modulates spindle formation and plays a critical role in guiding proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Centrosome aberrations, frequently seen in human tumors, may cause abnormal chromosome segregation and contribute to malignant transformation. To explore the components of the centrosomes, we previously identified a novel centrosomal protein called Q70YC4. To further characterize the Q70YC4-containing protein ensemble in the centrosome, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and isolated a number of Q70YC4-interacting molecules, including the centrosomal protein Q9NXR1. Here, we demonstrate that Q70YC4 can associate with Q9NXR1. Moreover, we found that Q9NXR1 is subjected to phosphorylation in vivo. In particular, we identified six putative P06493 phosphorylation sites in Q9NXR1 and found that alteration of these sites diminishes phosphorylation by P06493 in vitro and affects the stability of Q70YC4-Q9NXR1 interactions and the centrosomal localization of Q9NXR1. Ablation of Q9NXR1 by gene specific small interfering RNA causes mitotic delay and cell death, coupled with a modest decrease in the incidence of the cells that harbor excessive centrosomes. Collectively, our findings indicate that Q9NXR1 can form a protein complex with Q70YC4 in the centrosome and plays an important role for successful mitosis.","563":"P04626 overexpression in cancers causes hyperactivation of the PI 3-kinase pathway and elevated levels of the chemokine receptor P61073, which is strongly associated with increased metastatic potential. Here, we provide evidence that the cytokine-independent survival kinase Q96BR1 is activated downstream of the PI 3-kinase-dependent kinase Q15118 on endosomes and negatively regulates the lysosomal degradation of P61073. We demonstrate that Q96BR1 prevents P61073 degradation by inhibiting sorting of the receptor from early endosomes to lysosomes. In contrast, Q96BR1 does not interfere with ligand-induced degradation of epidermal growth factor receptors. Q96BR1 strongly interacts and colocalizes with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Q96J02, which is important for the ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation of P61073. Moreover, the observed inhibition is both dependent on the interaction between Q96BR1 and Q96J02 and on the activation status of Q96BR1. Consistent with this, an activated form of Q96BR1 but not of the related kinase O00141 phosphorylates specific sites of Q96J02 in vitro. Taken together, these results reveal a critical function of Q96BR1 in specifically attenuating ubiquitin-dependent degradation of P61073, and provide a mechanistic link between the PI 3-kinase pathway and P61073 stability.","704":"We identified the multifunctional chaperon protein Q07021 as a protein kinase C (PKC)-binding protein interacting with P17252, Q05513, Q05655, and Q15139. We have analyzed the interaction of Q15139 with Q07021 in detail, and we show here in vivo association of Q15139, as revealed from yeast two-hybrid analysis, precipitation assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation. In SKW 6.4 cells, Q15139 is constitutively associated with Q07021 at mitochondrial membranes, evident from colocalization with P99999. Q07021 interacts with Q15139 in a compartment-specific manner, as it can be coimmunoprecipitated mainly from the particulate and not from the soluble fraction, despite the presence of Q07021 in both fractions. Although Q07021 binds to the kinase domain of Q15139, it does not serve as a substrate. Interestingly, Q15139-Q07021 immunocomplexes precipitated from the particulate fraction of two distinct cell lines, SKW 6.4 and 293T, show no detectable substrate phosphorylation. In support of a kinase regulatory function of Q07021, addition of Q07021 to in vitro kinase assays blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, aldolase but not autophosphorylation of Q15139, suggesting a steric hindrance of substrate within the kinase domain. Together, these findings identify Q07021 as a novel, compartment-specific regulator of Q15139 kinase activity.","462":"It is thought that G(1) P12004\/CDK mediated phosphorylation of pocket proteins from mid G(1) to mitosis is reversed via dephosphorylation in mitosis. We examined the mechanisms involved in the unexpectedly rapid dephosphorylation of the pocket proteins induced via inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) as well as direct inhibition of CDKs by flavopiridol. CHX and flavopiridol-induced dephosphorylation of pocket proteins is attributable to inactivation of D-type P12004\/CDKs and G(1)\/S CDKs, respectively, which unmasks a phosphatase activity that targets the three pocket proteins apparently throughout the cell cycle. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors at concentrations selective for Q15257 inhibition prevents CHX and flavopiridol-mediated dephosphorylation of pocket proteins in vivo. Also, ectopic expression of SV40 small t antigen, which inhibits Q15257 via disruption of trimeric Q15257 holoenzymes, delays CHX-induced pocket protein dephosphorylation. Moreover, dephosphorylation of Q08999 and P28749 in cell extracts is inhibited by concentrations of okadaic acid known to inhibit Q15257, but not Q15181. Finally, the P67775 (5515;5524) specifically interacts with both Q08999 and P28749 in quiescent cells as well as cells progressing throughout the cell cycle. Together, these results demonstrate that the overall phosphorylation state of pocket proteins is determined, at least in part, by a dynamic equilibrium between CDKs and Q15257, or a closely related Q15257-like enzyme. These findings have important implications, as cell cycle or checkpoint-dependent inhibition of CDK activities counteracted by an active Q15257 should have imminent effects on the phosphorylation state and activities of pocket proteins.","848":"Q00613 (Q00613) monitors the structural integrity of intracellular proteins and its regulation is essential for the health and longevity of eukaryotic organisms. Q00613 also plays a role in the acute inflammatory response in the negative regulation of cytokine gene transcription. Here we show, for the first time, that Q00613 is regulated by the proinflammatory protein kinase P49137 (P49137). We have shown that P49137 directly phosphorylates Q00613 and inhibits activity by decreasing its ability to bind the heat shock elements (HSE) found in the promoters of target genes encoding the 7190 molecular chaperones and cytokine genes. We show that activation of Q00613 to bind HSE in 7190 promoters is inhibited through the phosphorylation of a specific residue, serine 121 by P49137. A potential mechanism for P49137-induced Q00613 inactivation is suggested by the findings that phosphorylation of serine 121 enhances Q00613 binding to P07900, a major repressor of Q00613. Dephosphorylation of serine 121 in cells exposed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs leads to P07900 dissociation from Q00613, which then forms active DNA binding trimers. These experiments indicate a novel mechanism for the regulation of Q00613 by proinflammatory signaling and may permit Q00613 to respond rapidly to extracellular events, permitting optimal
