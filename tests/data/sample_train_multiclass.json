    "1964": "The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, CDC34, has been implicated in the ubiquitination of a number of vertebrate substrates, including p27(Kip1), IkappaBalpha, Wee1, and MyoD. We show that mammalian CDC34 is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated in proliferating cells. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the regulatory (beta) subunit of human casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a CDC34-interacting protein and show that human CDC34 interacts in vivo with CK2beta in transfected cells. CDC34 is specifically phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant CK2 and HeLa nuclear extract at five sites within the carboxyl-terminal 36 amino acids of CDC34. Importantly, this phosphorylation is inhibited by heparin, a substrate-specific inhibitor of CK2. We have also identified a kinase activity associated with CDC34 in proliferating cells, and we show that this kinase is sensitive to heparin and can utilize GTP, strongly suggesting it is CK2. Phosphorylation of CDC34 by the associated kinase maps predominantly to residues 203 and 222. Mutation of CDC34 at CK2-targeted residues, Ser-203, Ser-222, Ser-231, Thr-233, and Ser-236, abolishes the phosphorylation of CDC34 observed in vivo and markedly shifts nuclearly localized CDC34 to the cytoplasm. These results suggest a potential role for CK2-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of CDC34 cell localization and function.",
    "2783": "Ca(2+) influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptor at excitatory synapses causes activation of post-synaptic Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) and its translocation to the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor. The major binding site for CaMKII on NR2B undergoes phosphorylation at Ser1303, in vivo. Even though some regulatory effects of this phosphorylation are known, the mode of dephosphorylation of NR2B-Ser1303 is still unclear. We show that phosphorylation status at Ser1303 enables NR2B to distinguish between the Ca(2+)\/calmodulin activated form and the autonomously active Thr286-autophosphorylated form of CaMKII. Green fluorescent protein-alpha-CaMKII co-expressed with NR2B sequence in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was used to study intracellular binding between the two proteins. Binding in vitro was studied by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay. Thr286-autophosphorylated alpha-CaMKII or the autophosphorylation mimicking mutant, T286D-alpha-CaMKII, binds NR2B sequence independent of Ca(2+)\/calmodulin unlike native wild-type alpha-CaMKII. We show enhancement of this binding by Ca(2+)\/calmodulin. Phosphorylation or a phosphorylation mimicking mutation on NR2B (NR2B-S1303D) abolishes the Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-independent binding whereas it allows the Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent binding of alpha-CaMKII in vitro. Similarly, the autonomously active mutants, T286D-alpha-CaMKII and F293E\/N294D-alpha-CaMKII, exhibited Ca(2+)-independent binding to non-phosphorylatable mutant of NR2B under intracellular conditions. We also show for the first time that phosphatases in the brain such as protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylate phospho-Ser1303 on NR2B.",
    "118": "The p53 tumor suppressor is activated in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Transactivation of p53 target genes dictates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or induction of apoptosis; however, a molecular mechanism responsible for these distinct functions remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of p53 on Ser(46) was associated with induction of p53AIP1 expression, resulting in the commitment of the cell fate into apoptotic cell death. Moreover, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, p53DINP1 was expressed and recruited a kinase(s) to p53 that specifically phosphorylated Ser(46). Here, we show that the pro-apoptotic kinase, protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta), is involved in phosphorylation of p53 on Ser(46). PKCdelta-mediated phosphorylation is required for the interaction of PKCdelta with p53. The results also demonstrate that p53DINP1 associates with PKCdelta upon exposure to genotoxic agents. Consistent with these results, PKCdelta potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis by Ser(46) phosphorylation in response to genotoxic stress. These findings indicate that PKCdelta regulates p53 to induce apoptotic cell death in the cellular response to DNA damage.",
    "2111": "The Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 protein antagonizes the early antiviral alpha\/beta interferon (IFN-alpha\/beta) response. We previously demonstrated that VP35 inhibits the virus-induced activation of the IFN-beta promoter by blocking the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a transcription factor that is crucial for the induction of IFN-alpha\/beta expression. Furthermore, VP35 blocks IFN-beta promoter activation induced by any of several components of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)\/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5)-activated signaling pathways including RIG-I, IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1), and IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon). These results suggested that VP35 may target the IRF kinases TBK-1 and IKKepsilon. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments now demonstrate physical interactions of VP35 with IKKepsilon and TBK-1, and the use of an IKKepsilon deletion construct further demonstrates that the amino-terminal kinase domain of IKKepsilon is sufficient for interactions with either IRF-3 or VP35. In vitro, either IKKepsilon or TBK-1 phosphorylates not only IRF-3 but also VP35. Moreover, VP35 overexpression impairs IKKepsilon-IRF-3, IKKepsilon-IRF-7, and IKKepsilon-IPS-1 interactions. Finally, lysates from cells overexpressing IKKepsilon contain kinase activity that can phosphorylate IRF-3 in vitro. When VP35 is expressed in the IKKepsilon-expressing cells, this kinase activity is suppressed. These data suggest that VP35 exerts its IFN-antagonist function, at least in part, by blocking necessary interactions between the kinases IKKepsilon and TBK-1 and their normal interaction partners, including their substrates, IRF-3 and IRF-7.",
    "1832": "The calcium\/calmodulin-dependent kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2 kinase; eEF2K) is subject to multisite phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. Phosphorylation at Ser359 inhibits eEF2K activity even at high calcium concentrations. To identify the kinase that phosphorylates Ser359 in eEF2K, we developed an extensive purification protocol. Tryptic mass fingerprint analysis identified it as cdc2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1). cdc2 co-purifies with Ser359 kinase activity and cdc2-cyclin B complexes phosphorylate eEF2K at Ser359. We demonstrate that cdc2 contributes to controlling eEF2 phosphorylation in cells. cdc2 is activated early in mitosis. Kinase activity against Ser359 in eEF2K also peaks at this stage of the cell cycle and eEF2 phosphorylation is low in mitotic cells. Inactivation of eEF2K by cdc2 may serve to keep eEF2 active during mitosis (where calcium levels rise) and thereby permit protein synthesis to proceed in mitotic cells. Amino-acid starvation decreases cdc2's activity against eEF2K, whereas loss of TSC2 (a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1)) increases it. These data closely match the control of Ser359 phosphorylation and indicate that cdc2 may be regulated by mTORC1.",
    "576": "In HEK293 cells, transfected with the Ca2+ channel protein TRPV6, Ca2+ influx is increased and TRPV6 is tyrosine phosphorylated following addition of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor N,N-dimethyl-hydroxamido hydroxovanadate to cells. This effect of DMHV is enhanced by co-transfection of cells with the tyrosine kinase Src and the tyrosine phosphatase 1B. It is abolished when cells had been treated with PP1, an inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases. PTP1B interacts with the N-terminal domain of TRPV6 within a region of amino acids 1-191 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and the yeast 2-hybrid system. Point mutation of both tyrosines 161 and 162 in the TRPV6 protein abolishes the DMHV-effect on Ca2+ influx and tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. Single mutations of Y161 or Y162 shows that each of both tyrosines alone is sufficient for the DMHV-effect. We conclude that phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation of tyrosines in position 161 and 162 is essential for regulation of Ca2+ influx through TRPV6 Ca2+ channels in HEK293 cells.",
    "42": "To gain insight into the function of human protein kinase X (PrKX), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, T54 and Smad6 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between PrKX and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between Smad6 and PrKX was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that PrKX phosphorylates Smad6 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of PrKX phosphorylation. Both PrKX and Smad6 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where PrKX levels are induced and Smad6 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of Smad6 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation Smad6 displays an increased binding to the human osteopontin, Id2, and Hex gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both Smad6 and PrKX proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.",
    "628": "Previous reports have suggested that human CD4(+) CD25(hi)FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) have functional plasticity and may differentiate into effector T cells under inflammation. The molecular mechanisms underlying these findings remain unclear. Here we identified the residue serine 422 of human FOXP3 as a phosphorylation site that regulates its function, which is not present in murine Foxp3. PIM1 kinase, which is highly expressed in human Tregs, was found to be able to interact with and to phosphorylate human FOXP3 at serine 422. T cell receptor (TCR) signaling inhibits PIM1 induction, whereas IL-6 promotes PIM1 expression in in vitro expanded human Tregs. PIM1 negatively regulates FOXP3 chromatin binding activity by specifically phosphorylating FOXP3 at Ser(422). Our data also suggest that phosphorylation of FOXP3 at the Ser(418) site could prevent FOXP3 phosphorylation at Ser(422) mediated by PIM1. Knockdown of PIM1 in in vitro expanded human Tregs promoted FOXP3-induced target gene expression, including CD25, CTLA4, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), or weakened FOXP3-suppressed IL-2 gene expression and enhanced the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. Furthermore, PIM1-specific inhibitor boosted FOXP3 DNA binding activity in in vitro expanded primary Tregs and also enhanced their suppressive activity toward the proliferation of T effector cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that PIM1 could be a new potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of human-specific autoimmune diseases because of its ability to modulate the immunosuppressive activity of human Tregs. ",
    "485": "Foxp3 is a transcription factor required for the development of regulatory T cells (Treg). Mice and humans with a loss of Foxp3 function suffer from uncontrolled autoimmunity and inflammatory disease. Expression of Foxp3 is necessary for the anti-inflammatory capacity of Treg, but whether Foxp3 activity is further subject to regulation by extracellular signals is unclear. The primary structure of Foxp3 contains four cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) motifs (Ser\/Thr-Pro) within the N-terminal repressor domain, and we show that CDK2 can partner with cyclin E to phosphorylate Foxp3 at these sites. Consistent with our previous demonstration that CDK2 negatively regulates Treg function, we find that mutation of the serine or threonine at each CDK motif to alanine (S\/T\u2192A) results in enhanced Foxp3 protein stability in CD4(+) T cells. T cells expressing the S\/T\u2192A mutant of Foxp3 showed enhanced induction (e.g. CD25) and repression (e.g. IL2) of canonical Foxp3-responsive genes, exhibited an increased capacity to suppress conventional T cell proliferation in vitro, and were highly effective at ameliorating colitis in an in vivo model of inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicate that CDK2 negatively regulates the stability and activity of Foxp3 and implicate CDK-coupled receptor signal transduction in the control of regulatory T cell function and stability.

    "1483": "Involvement of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) in promoting cell activation requires its release from autoinhibitory structural constraints and has been attributed to WASp association with activated cdc42. Here, however, we show that T cell development and T cell receptor (TCR)-induced proliferation and actin polymerization proceed normally in WASp-\/- mice expressing a WASp transgene lacking the cdc42 binding domain. By contrast, mutation of tyrosine residue Y291, identified here as the major site of TCR-induced WASp tyrosine phosphorylation, abrogated induction of WASp tyrosine phosphorylation and its effector activities, including nuclear factor of activated T cell transcriptional activity, actin polymerization, and immunological synapse formation. TCR-induced WASp tyrosine phosphorylation was also disrupted in T cells lacking Fyn, a kinase shown here to bind, colocalize with, and phosphorylate WASp. By contrast, WASp was tyrosine dephosphorylated by protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST, a tyrosine phosphatase shown here to interact with WASp via proline, serine, threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PSTPIP)1 binding. Although Fyn enhanced WASp-mediated Arp2\/3 activation and was required for synapse formation, PTP-PEST combined with PSTPIP1 inhibited WASp-driven actin polymerization and synapse formation. These observations identify key roles for Fyn and PTP-PEST in regulating WASp and imply that inducible WASp tyrosine phosphorylation can occur independently of cdc42 binding, but unlike the cdc42 interaction, is absolutely required for WASp contributions to T cell activation.",
    "2730": "Glucocorticoid resistance is a major driver of therapeutic failure in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we identify the AKT1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.",
    "3200": "The adipocyte-rich microenvironment forms a niche for ovarian cancer metastasis, but the mechanisms driving this process are incompletely understood. Here we show that salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is overexpressed in adipocyte-rich metastatic deposits compared with ovarian primary lesions. Overexpression of SIK2 in ovarian cancer cells promotes abdominal metastasis while SIK2 depletion prevents metastasis in\u00a0vivo. Importantly, adipocytes induce calcium-dependent activation and autophosphorylation of SIK2. Activated SIK2 plays a dual role in augmenting AMPK-induced phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in activating the PI3K\/AKT pathway through p85\u03b1-S154 phosphorylation. These findings identify SIK2 at the apex of the adipocyte-induced signaling cascades in cancer cells and make a compelling case for targeting SIK2 for therapy in ovarian cancer.",
    "1028": "The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase MKP-1\/CL100\/DUSP1 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by p44\/42 MAPK (ERK1\/2) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering MKP-1 proteolysis. Active ERK2 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated MKP-1 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)\/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)\/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)\/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated MKP-1 proteolysis stimulated by MKK1-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)\/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 and the degradation of MKP-1. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 bound to SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Skp2 enhanced MKP-1 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Skp2 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous MKP-1 degradation rate in a Skp2-dependent manner. Thus, MKP-1 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and SCF(Skp2) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.",
    "2253": "p27Kip1 controls cell proliferation by binding to and regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Here we show that Cdk inhibition and p27 stability are regulated through direct phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. A conserved tyrosine residue (Y88) in the Cdk-binding domain of p27 can be phosphorylated by the Src-family kinase Lyn and the oncogene product BCR-ABL. Y88 phosphorylation does not prevent p27 binding to cyclin A\/Cdk2. Instead, it causes phosphorylated Y88 and the entire inhibitory 3(10)-helix of p27 to be ejected from the Cdk2 active site, thus restoring partial Cdk activity. Importantly, this allows Y88-phosphorylated p27 to be efficiently phosphorylated on threonine 187 by Cdk2 which in turn promotes its SCF-Skp2-dependent degradation. This direct link between transforming tyrosine kinases and p27 may provide an explanation for Cdk kinase activities observed in p27 complexes and for premature p27 elimination in cells that have been transformed by activated tyrosine kinases.",
    "1596": "The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1, also known as CD148, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes. Expression of DEP1 is enhanced at high cell density, and this observation suggests that DEP1 may function in the regulation of cell adhesion and possibly contact inhibition of cell growth. In order to investigate the function of DEP1, substrate-trapping mutants of the phosphatase were used to identify potential substrates. GST-fusion proteins containing the DEP1 catalytic domain with a substrate-trapping D\/A mutation were found to interact with p120(ctn), a component of adherens junctions. DEP1 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including beta-catenin and gamma-catenin. The interaction with p120(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression. Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-PEST, CD45, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of DEP1 with these proteins is specific. DEP1 expression was concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in A549 cells. p120(ctn) was found to colocalize with these structures. Together these data suggest an important role for DEP-1 in the function of cell-cell contacts and adherens junctions.",
    "833": "Interleukin 7 (IL-7) has a critical role in the development of early CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative (DN) thymocytes. Although the transcription factor STAT5 is an important component of IL-7 signaling, differences in the phenotypes of mice deficient in STAT5, IL-7, IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7r\u03b1) or the kinase Jak3 suggest the existence of STAT5-independent IL-7 signaling. Here we found that IL-7-Jak3 signals activated the transcription factor NFATc1 in DN thymocytes by phosphorylating Tyr371 in the regulatory region of NFATc1. This NFAT-activation pathway was critical for the survival and development of DN thymocytes, as deficiency in NFATc1 blocked thymocyte development at the DN1 stage, leading to T cell lymphopenia. In addition, our results demonstrated a cooperative function for NFATc1 and STAT5 in guiding thymocyte development in response to IL-7 signals.",
    "2428": "Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, respectively. PTPN22 (Lyp), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of PTPN22. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using PTPN22-D195A\/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of PTPN22. These included three novel PTPN22 substrates (Vav, CD3epsilon, and valosin containing protein) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of PTPN22 (Lck and Zap70). T cell antigen receptor (TCR) zeta was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that PTPN22-D195A\/C227S interacted directly with activated Lck, Zap70, and TCRzeta, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native PTPN22 dephosphorylated Lck and Zap70 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (Lck) or Tyr-319 (Zap70). Native PTPN22 also dephosphorylated TCRzeta in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRzeta when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRzeta as a direct substrate of PTPN22.",
    "3003": "The effect of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation I2020T on its kinase activity has been controversial, with both increased and decreased effects being reported. We conducted steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic studies on LRRKtide and its analog LRRKtide(S). Their phosphorylation differs by the rate-limiting steps: product release is rate-limiting for LRRKtide and phosphoryl transfer is rate-limiting for LRRKtide(S). As a result, we observed that the I2020T mutant is more active than wild type (WT) LRRK2 for LRRKtide(S) phosphorylation, whereas it is less active than WT for LRRKtide phosphorylation. Our pre-steady-state kinetic data suggest that (i) the I2020T mutant accelerates the rates of phosphoryl transfer of both reactions by 3-7-fold; (ii) this increase is masked by a rate-limiting product release step for LRRKtide phosphorylation; and (iii) the observed lower activity of the mutant for LRRKtide phosphorylation is a consequence of its instability: the concentration of the active form of the mutant is 3-fold lower than WT. The I2020T mutant has a dramatically low KATP and therefore leads to resistance to ATP competitive inhibitors. Two well known DFG-out or type II inhibitors are also weaker toward the mutant because they inhibit the mutant in an unexpected ATP competitive mechanism. The I2020 residue lies next to the DYG motif of the activation loop of the LRRK2 kinase domain. Our modeling and metadynamic simulations suggest that the I2020T mutant stabilizes the DYG-in active conformation and creates an unusual allosteric pocket that can bind type II inhibitors but in an ATP competitive fashion. ",
    "1111": "Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an essential role in antigen receptor-initiated lymphocyte activation. Their activity is largely regulated by a negative regulatory tyrosine which is a substrate for the activating action of the CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) or, conversely, the suppressing action of the cytosolic p50csk PTK. Here we report that CD45 was phosphorylated by p50csk on two tyrosine residues, one of them identified as Tyr-1193. This residue was not phosphorylated by T-cell PTKs p56lck and p59fyn. Tyr-1193 was phosphorylated in intact T cells, and phosphorylation increased upon treatment with PTPase inhibitors, indicating that this tyrosine is a target for a constitutively active PTK. Cotransfection of CD45 and csk into COS-1 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 in the intact cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CD45 bound p56lck through the SH2 domain of the kinase. Finally, p50csk-mediated phosphorylation of CD45 caused a severalfold increase in its PTPase activity. Our results show that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 can affect its activity and association with Src family PTKs and that this phosphorylation could be mediated by p50csk. If this is also true in the intact cells, it adds a new dimension to the physiological function of p50csk in T lymphocytes.",
    "3045": "Most eukaryotic cells elaborate several proteoglycans critical for transmitting biochemical signals into and between cells. However, the regulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis is not completely understood. We show that the atypical secretory kinase family with sequence similarity 20, member B (Fam20B) phosphorylates the initiating xylose residue in the proteoglycan tetrasaccharide linkage region, and that this event functions as a molecular switch to regulate subsequent glycosaminoglycan assembly. Proteoglycans from FAM20B knockout cells contain a truncated tetrasaccharide linkage region consisting of a disaccharide capped with sialic acid (Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4Xyl\u03b21) that cannot be further elongated. We also show that the activity of galactosyl transferase II (GalT-II, B3GalT6), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide linkage region, is dramatically increased by Fam20B-dependent xylose phosphorylation. Inactivating mutations in the GALT-II gene (B3GALT6) associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cause proteoglycan maturation defects similar to FAM20B deletion. Collectively, our findings suggest that GalT-II function is impaired by loss of Fam20B-dependent xylose phosphorylation and reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism for regulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis. ",
    "3222": "It is thought that G(1) cyclin\/CDK mediated phosphorylation of pocket proteins from mid G(1) to mitosis is reversed via dephosphorylation in mitosis. We examined the mechanisms involved in the unexpectedly rapid dephosphorylation of the pocket proteins induced via inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) as well as direct inhibition of CDKs by flavopiridol. CHX and flavopiridol-induced dephosphorylation of pocket proteins is attributable to inactivation of D-type cyclin\/CDKs and G(1)\/S CDKs, respectively, which unmasks a phosphatase activity that targets the three pocket proteins apparently throughout the cell cycle. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors at concentrations selective for PP2A inhibition prevents CHX and flavopiridol-mediated dephosphorylation of pocket proteins in vivo. Also, ectopic expression of SV40 small t antigen, which inhibits PP2A via disruption of trimeric PP2A holoenzymes, delays CHX-induced pocket protein dephosphorylation. Moreover, dephosphorylation of p130 and p107 in cell extracts is inhibited by concentrations of okadaic acid known to inhibit PP2A, but not PP1. Finally, the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A\/C) specifically interacts with both p130 and p107 in quiescent cells as well as cells progressing throughout the cell cycle. Together, these results demonstrate that the overall phosphorylation state of pocket proteins is determined, at least in part, by a dynamic equilibrium between CDKs and PP2A, or a closely related PP2A-like enzyme. These findings have important implications, as cell cycle or checkpoint-dependent inhibition of CDK activities counteracted by an active PP2A should have imminent effects on the phosphorylation state and activities of pocket proteins.",
    "534": "Leukocyte protein tyrosine phosphatase (LC-PTP)\/hemopoietic PTP is a human cytoplasmic PTP that is predominantly expressed in the hemopoietic cells. Recently, it was reported that hemopoietic PTP inhibited TCR-mediated signal transduction. However, the precise mechanism of the inhibition was not identified. Here we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is the direct target of LC-PTP. LC-PTP dephosphorylated ERK2 in vitro. Expression of wild-type LC-PTP in 293T cells suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK2 by a mutant MEK1, which was constitutively active regardless of upstream activation signals. No suppression of the phosphorylation was observed by LC-PTPCS, a catalytically inactive mutant. In Jurkat cells, LC-PTP suppressed the ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. LC-PTP and LC-PTPCS made complexes with ERK1, ERK2, and p38alpha, but not with the gain-of-function sevenmaker ERK2 mutant (D321N). A small deletion (aa 1-46) in the N-terminal portion of LC-PTP or Arg to Ala substitutions at aa 41 and 42 resulted in the loss of ERK binding activity. These LC-PTP mutants revealed little inhibition of the ERK cascade activated by TCR cross-linking. On the other hand, the wild-type LC-PTP did not suppress the phosphorylation of sevenmaker ERK2 mutant. Thus, the complex formation of LC-PTP with ERK is the essential mechanism for the suppression. Taken collectively, these results indicate that LC-PTP suppresses mitogen-activated protein kinase directly in vivo.",
    "649": "We have recently shown that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) associates with the docking protein p130Cas in 3Y1 rat fibroblasts. This interaction is mediated by a proline-rich sequence on PTP1B and the SH3 domain on p130Cas. Expression of wild-type PTP1B (WT-PTP1B), but not a catalytically competent, proline-to-alanine point mutant that cannot bind p130Cas (PA-PTP1B), causes substantial tyrosine dephosphorylation of p130Cas (F. Liu, D. E. Hill, and J. Chernoff, J. Biol. Chem. 271:31290-31295, 1996). Here we demonstrate that WT-, but not PA-PTP1B, inhibits transformation of rat 3Y1 fibroblasts by v-crk, -src, and -ras, but not by v-raf. These effects on transformation correlate with the phosphorylation status of p130Cas and two proteins that are associated with p130Cas, Paxillin and Fak. Expression of WT-PTP1B reduces formation of p130Cas-Crk complexes and inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by Src and Crk. These data show that transformation suppression by PTP1B requires a functional SH3 ligand and suggest that p130Cas may represent an important physiological target of PTP1B in cells.",
    "482": "The tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway controls tissue homeostasis through balancing cell proliferation and apoptosis. Activation of the kinases Mst1 and Mst2 (Mst1\/2) is a key upstream event in this pathway and remains poorly understood. Mst1\/2 and their critical regulators RASSFs contain Salvador\/RASSF1A\/Hippo (SARAH) domains that can homo- and heterodimerize. Here, we report the crystal structures of human Mst2 alone and bound to RASSF5. Mst2 undergoes activation through transautophosphorylation at its activation loop, which requires SARAH-mediated homodimerization. RASSF5 disrupts Mst2 homodimer and blocks Mst2 autoactivation. Binding of RASSF5 to already activated Mst2, however, does not inhibit its kinase activity. Thus, RASSF5 can act as an inhibitor or a potential positive regulator of Mst2, depending on whether it binds to Mst2 before or after activation-loop phosphorylation. We propose that these temporally sensitive functions of RASSFs enable the Hippo pathway to respond to and integrate diverse cellular signals.",
    "1371": "We and others previously identified NKX2-1, also known as TITF1 and TTF-1, as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinomas. Here we show that NKX2-1 induces the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), which in turn sustains a favorable balance between prosurvival PI3K-AKT and pro-apoptotic p38 signaling, in part through ROR1 kinase-dependent c-Src activation, as well as kinase activity-independent sustainment of the EGFR-ERBB3 association, ERBB3 phosphorylation, and consequential PI3K activation. Notably, ROR1 knockdown effectively inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, irrespective of their EGFR status, including those with resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Our findings thus identify ROR1 as an \"Achilles' heel\" in lung adenocarcinoma, warranting future development of therapeutic strategies for this devastating cancer.",
    "1135": "Indiscriminately suppressing total c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity is not an appropriate strategy because each JNK appears to have a distinct function in cancer, asthma, diabetes, or Parkinson's disease. Herein, we report that 7-(6-N-phenylaminohexyl)amino-2H-anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6-one (AV-7) inhibited JNK1 activity, but not JNK2 or JNK3. We found that ultraviolet B (UVB) induced c-Jun phosphorylation and sub-G1 accumulation in JNK2(-\/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts, which contain an abundance of JNK1, but not JNK2. These results demonstrate that AV-7 is an isoform selective small-molecule inhibitor of JNK1 activity, which might be developed as a therapeutic against diabetes.",
    "2751": "The enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the control of several metabolic enzymes and transcription factors in response to extracellular signals. In the past, the enzyme has been considered to be a protein Ser\/Thr kinase although it was recently reported to contain Tyr(P) (Hughes, K., Nikolakaki, E., Plyte, S. E., Totty, N. F., and Woodgett, J. R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 803-808). A cDNA encoding rabbit skeletal muscle GSK-3 beta was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as an active protein kinase, with apparent M(r) 46,000, capable of phosphorylating several known GSK-3 substrates. Recombinant GSK-3 beta autophosphorylated on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues although the enzyme already contained Tyr(P) as judged by its recognition by anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. The net result of the autophosphorylation was a 3-5-fold reduction in enzyme activity. GSK-3 alpha, purified from rabbit muscle, also underwent autophosphorylation but only on Ser and Thr residues. In this case, the autophosphorylation stabilized the enzyme activity compared with the control lacking ATP\/Mg2+. Of several phosphatases tested, the lambda-phage phosphatase was the most effective in dephosphorylating at Ser and Thr residues but did not dephosphorylate at Tyr residues. The action of the lambda-phosphatase caused a reactivation of GSK-3 beta to approximately 80% of the starting activity. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B was able to dephosphorylate at Tyr residues leading to a reduction in enzyme activity. A truncated form of GSK-3 beta, apparent M(r) 40,000, had a significantly higher specific activity, was defective in autophosphorylation, and was not inactivated in the autophosphorylation reaction. We conclude that GSK-3 beta is a dual specificity protein kinase in the same sense as the mitogen-activated protein kinase\/ERK family of enzymes. Phosphorylation at different residues differentially controls enzyme activity, Ser\/Thr phosphorylation causing inactivation and Tyr phosphorylation resulting in increased activity.",
    "2187": "Short-patch repair of DNA single-strand breaks and gaps (SSB) is coordinated by XRCC1, a scaffold protein that recruits the DNA polymerase and DNA ligase required for filling and sealing the damaged strand. XRCC1 can also recruit end-processing enzymes, such as PNK (polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase), Aprataxin and APLF (aprataxin\/PNK-like factor), which ensure the availability of a free 3'-hydroxyl on one side of the gap, and a 5'-phosphate group on the other, for the polymerase and ligase reactions respectively. PNK binds to a phosphorylated segment of XRCC1 (between its two C-terminal BRCT domains) via its Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. We show here, contrary to previous studies, that the FHA domain of PNK binds specifically, and with high affinity to a multiply phosphorylated motif in XRCC1 containing a pSer-pThr dipeptide, and forms a 2:1 PNK:XRCC1 complex. The high-resolution crystal structure of a PNK-FHA-XRCC1 phosphopeptide complex reveals the basis for this unusual bis-phosphopeptide recognition, which is probably a common feature of the known XRCC1-associating end-processing enzymes.",
    "330": "Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) function as co-activators for a variety of sequence-specific transcription factors, including AML1. Here, we report that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) forms a complex with AML1 and p300, and phosphorylates both AML1 and p300 to stimulate transcription activation as well as HAT activities. Phosphorylation of p300 is triggered by phosphorylated AML1 as well as by PU.1, c-MYB, c-JUN and c-FOS, and is inhibited by dominant-negative HIPK2. Phosphorylation of p300 and AML1 is impaired in Hipk1\/2 double-deficient mouse embryos. Double-deficient mice exhibit defects in primitive\/definitive hematopoiesis, vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and neural tube closure. These phenotypes are in part similar to those observed in p300- and CBP-deficient mice. HIPK2 also phosphorylates another co-activator, MOZ, in an AML1-dependent manner. We discuss a possible mechanism by which transcription factors could regulate local histone acetylation and transcription of their target genes.",
    "65": "Nuclear retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RARs) activate gene expression through dynamic interactions with coregulators in coordination with the ligand and phosphorylation processes. Here we show that during RA-dependent activation of the RARalpha isotype, the p160 coactivator pCIP\/ACTR\/AIB-1\/RAC-3\/TRAM-1\/SRC-3 is phosphorylated by p38MAPK. SRC-3 phosphorylation has been correlated to an initial facilitation of RARalpha-target genes activation, via the control of the dynamics of the interactions of the coactivator with RARalpha. Then, phosphorylation inhibits transcription via promoting the degradation of SRC-3. In line with this, inhibition of p38MAPK markedly enhances RARalpha-mediated transcription and RA-dependent induction of cell differentiation. SRC-3 phosphorylation and degradation occur only within the context of RARalpha complexes, suggesting that the RAR isotype defines a phosphorylation code through dictating the accessibility of the coactivator to p38MAPK. We propose a model in which RARalpha transcriptional activity is regulated by SRC-3 through coordinated events that are fine-tuned by RA and p38MAPK.",
    "123": "D-sites are a class of MAPK-docking sites that have been found in many MAPK regulators and substrates. A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) MEK1, MEK2, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. Here we demonstrated that MKK7 recognizes its target JNK by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of MKK7. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind JNK1 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length MKK7 containing combined D1\/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to JNK1 and exhibited reduced JNK1 kinase activity when compared with wild-type MKK7. Peptide versions of the D-sites from MKK4 or the JIP-1 scaffold protein inhibited MKK7-JNK binding, suggesting that all three JNK regulators bind to the same region of JNK. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of MKK7 inhibited the ability of JNK1 and JNK2 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates c-Jun and ATF2, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with MKK7 for docking to JNK. Finally, MKK7-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of JNK1 versus ERK2. We conclude that MKK7 contains three JNK-docking sites that interact to selectively bind JNK and contribute to JNK signal transmission and specificity.",
    "732": "Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by inflammatory cytokines involves the successive action of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and two IkappaB kinases, IKK-alpha and IKK-beta. Here we show that NIK preferentially phosphorylates IKK-alpha over IKK-beta, leading to the activation of IKK-alpha kinase activity. This phosphorylation of IKK-alpha occurs specifically on Ser-176 in the activation loop between kinase subdomains VII and VIII. A mutant form of IKK-alpha containing alanine at residue 176 cannot be phosphorylated or activated by NIK and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of interleukin 1- and tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-kappaB activation. Conversely, a mutant form of IKK-alpha containing glutamic acid at residue 176 is constitutively active. Thus, the phosphorylation of IKK-alpha on Ser-176 by NIK may be required for cytokine-mediated NF-kappaB activation.",
    "1462": "Synaptojanin 1 is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase concentrated in presynaptic nerve terminals, where it dephosphorylates a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling. Like other proteins with a role in endocytosis, synaptojanin 1 undergoes constitutive phosphorylation in resting synapses and stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation by calcineurin. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates synaptojanin 1 and regulates its function both in vitro and in intact synaptosomes. Cdk5 phosphorylation inhibited the inositol 5-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin 1, whereas dephosphorylation by calcineurin stimulated such activity. The activity of synaptojanin 1 was also stimulated by its interaction with endophilin 1, its major binding partner at the synapse. Notably, Cdk5 phosphorylated serine 1144, which is adjacent to the endophilin binding site. Mutation of serine 1144 to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation by Cdk5 inhibited the interaction of synaptojanin 1 with endophilin 1. These results suggest that Cdk5 and calcineurin may have an antagonistic role in the regulation of synaptojanin 1 recruitment and activity, and therefore in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate turnover at synapses.",
    "1209": "Alix\/AIP1 is an adaptor protein involved in regulating the function of receptor and cytoskeleton-associated tyrosine kinases. Here, we investigated its interaction with and regulation by Src. Tyr319 of Alix bound the isolated Src homology-2 (SH2) domain and was necessary for interaction with intact Src. A proline-rich region in the C terminus of Alix bound the Src SH3 domain, but this interaction was dependent on the release of the Src SH2 domain from its Src internal ligand either by interaction with Alix Tyr319 or by mutation of Src Tyr527. Src phosphorylated Alix at a C-terminal region rich in tyrosines, an activity that was stimulated by the presence of the Alix binding partner SETA\/CIN85. Phosphorylation of Alix by Src caused it to translocate from the membrane and cytoskeleton to the cytoplasm and reduced its interaction with binding partners SETA\/CIN85, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Pyk2. As a consequence of this, Src antagonized the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase internalization and cell adhesion by Alix. We propose a model whereby Src antagonizes the effects of Alix by phosphorylation of its C terminus, leading to the disruption of interactions with target proteins.",
    "2820": "Upon leptin binding, the leptin receptor is activated, leading to stimulation of the JAK\/STAT signal transduction cascade. The transient character of the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 suggests the involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as negative regulators of this signalling pathway. Specifically, recent evidence has suggested that PTP1B might be a key regulator of leptin signalling, based on the resistance to diet-induced obesity and increased leptin signalling observed in PTP1B-deficient mice. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism by which PTP1B mediates the cessation of the leptin signal transduction. Leptin-induced activation of a STAT3 responsive reporter was dose-dependently inhibited by co-transfection with PTP1B. No inhibition was observed when a catalytically inactive mutant of PTP1B was used or when other PTPs were co-transfected. PTP1B was able to dephosphorylate activated JAK2 and STAT3 in vitro, whereas either no or a minimal effect was observed with cluster of differentiation 45 (CD45), PTPalpha and leukocyte antigen-related (LAR). By utilisation of a selective PTP1B inhibitor, the leptin-induced STAT3 activation was enhanced in cells. In conclusion, these results suggested that the negative regulatory role of PTP1B on leptin signalling is mediated through a direct and selective dephosphorylation of the two signalling molecules, JAK2 and STAT3.",
    "2998": "Maintenance of chromosomal stability relies on coordination between various processes that are critical for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Here we show that monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) kinase, which is essential for the mitotic checkpoint, also controls correction of improper chromosome attachments. We report that Borealin\/DasraB, a member of the complex that regulates the Aurora B kinase, is directly phosphorylated by Mps1 on residues that are crucial for Aurora B activity and chromosome alignment. As a result, cells lacking Mps1 kinase activity fail to efficiently align chromosomes due to impaired Aurora B function at centromeres, leaving improper attachments uncorrected. Strikingly, Borealin\/DasraB bearing phosphomimetic mutations restores Aurora B activity and alignment in Mps1-depleted cells. Mps1 thus coordinates attachment error correction and checkpoint signaling, two crucial responses to unproductive chromosome attachments.",
    "910": "The activation of NF-kappaB has been shown to be regulated by multiple phosphorylations of IkappaBs and the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. Here, we characterized the intracellular signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of p65 on Ser-536 using a novel anti-phospho-p65 (Ser-536) antibody. The Ser-536 of endogenous p65 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of NF-kappaB stimulants including TNF-alpha in the cytoplasm and rapidly dephosphorylated in the nucleus. The TNF-alpha-but not IL-1beta-induced Ser-536 phosphorylation was severely impaired in murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from traf2-\/-traf5-\/- mice. Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IkappaB phosphorylation, inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation in vivo. In addition, overexpression of TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), IKKalpha and IKKbeta stimulated the phosphorylation, and their dominant negative mutants blocked the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation. Moreover, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against TAK1, IKKalpha and IKKbeta blocked the phosphorylation of endogenous p65. On the other hand, calyculin-A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, blocked the dephosphorylation in the nucleus in vivo. These results indicate that similar signaling pathways were utilized for the phosphorylations of IkappaBalpha and p65, which further support the idea that both IkappaB and NF-kappaB are substrates for the IKK complex in the activation of NF-kappaB.",
    "2287": "14-3-3 proteins control various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA damage checkpoint. At the DNA damage checkpoint, some subtypes of 14-3-3 (beta and zeta isoforms in mammalian cells and Rad24 in fission yeast) bind to Ser345-phosphorylated Chk1 and promote its nuclear retention. Here, we report that 14-3-3gamma forms a complex with Chk1 phosphorylated at Ser296, but not at ATR sites (Ser317 and Ser345). Ser296 phosphorylation is catalysed by Chk1 itself after Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR, and then ATR sites are rapidly dephosphorylated on Ser296-phosphorylated Chk1. Although Ser345 phosphorylation is observed at nuclear DNA damage foci, it occurs more diffusely in the nucleus. The replacement of endogenous Chk1 with Chk1 mutated at Ser296 to Ala induces premature mitotic entry after ultraviolet irradiation, suggesting the importance of Ser296 phosphorylation in the DNA damage response. Although Ser296 phosphorylation induces the only marginal change in Chk1 catalytic activity, 14-3-3gamma mediates the interaction between Chk1 and Cdc25A. This ternary complex formation has an essential function in Cdc25A phosphorylation and degradation to block premature mitotic entry after DNA damage.",
    "2416": "Che-1 is a RNA polymerase II-binding protein involved in the transcription of E2F target genes and induction of cell proliferation. Here we show that Che-1 contributes to DNA damage response and that its depletion sensitizes cells to anticancer agents. The checkpoint kinases ATM\/ATR and Chk2 interact with Che-1 and promote its phosphorylation and accumulation in response to DNA damage. These Che-1 modifications induce a specific recruitment of Che-1 on the TP53 and p21 promoters. Interestingly, it has a profound effect on the basal expression of p53, which is preserved following DNA damage. Notably, Che-1 contributes to the maintenance of the G2\/M checkpoint induced by DNA damage. These findings identify a mechanism by which checkpoint kinases regulate responses to DNA damage.",
    "1815": "The serine\/threonine kinase Pim is known to promote cell cycle progression and to inhibit apoptosis leading to tumorigenesis. However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We show, herein, that all the Pim family members (Pim1, Pim2, and Pim3) bind to and directly phosphorylate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) at threonine-157 and threonine-198 residues in cells and in vitro. The Pim-mediated phosphorylation induced p27(Kip1) binding to 14-3-3 protein, resulting in its nuclear export and proteasome-dependent degradation. Ectopic expression of Pim kinases overcome the G(1) arrest mediated by wild-type p27(Kip1) but not by phosphorylation-resistant T157A-p27(Kip1) or T198A-p27(Kip1). In addition to the posttranslational regulations, p27(Kip1) promoter assay revealed that Pim kinases also had the ability to suppress p27(Kip1) transcription. Pim-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of forkhead transcription factors, FoxO1a and FoxO3a, was involved in the transcriptional repression of the p27(Kip1) gene. In contrast, inhibition of Pim signaling by expressing the dominant-negative form of Pim1 increased nuclear p27(Kip1) level and attenuated cell proliferation. Because the CDK inhibitor p27(Kip1) plays a crucial role in tumor suppression by inhibiting abnormal cell cycle progression, Pim kinases promote cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis by down-regulating p27(Kip1) expression at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels.",
    "2343": "The adipocyte-rich microenvironment forms a niche for ovarian cancer metastasis, but the mechanisms driving this process are incompletely understood. Here we show that salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is overexpressed in adipocyte-rich metastatic deposits compared with ovarian primary lesions. Overexpression of SIK2 in ovarian cancer cells promotes abdominal metastasis while SIK2 depletion prevents metastasis in\u00a0vivo. Importantly, adipocytes induce calcium-dependent activation and autophosphorylation of SIK2. Activated SIK2 plays a dual role in augmenting AMPK-induced phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in activating the PI3K\/AKT pathway through p85\u03b1-S154 phosphorylation. These findings identify SIK2 at the apex of the adipocyte-induced signaling cascades in cancer cells and make a compelling case for targeting SIK2 for therapy in ovarian cancer.",
    "3143": "Dysfunction and loss of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells represent hallmarks of diabetes mellitus. Here, we show that mice lacking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38delta display improved glucose tolerance due to enhanced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Deletion of p38delta results in pronounced activation of protein kinase D (PKD), the latter of which we have identified as a pivotal regulator of stimulated insulin exocytosis. p38delta catalyzes an inhibitory phosphorylation of PKD1, thereby attenuating stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, p38delta null mice are protected against high-fat-feeding-induced insulin resistance and oxidative stress-mediated beta cell failure. Inhibition of PKD1 reverses enhanced insulin secretion from p38delta-deficient islets and glucose tolerance in p38delta null mice as well as their susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, the p38delta-PKD pathway integrates regulation of the insulin secretory capacity and survival of pancreatic beta cells, pointing to a pivotal role for this pathway in the development of overt diabetes mellitus.",
    "1058": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated to act as second messengers in a number of signal transduction pathways, including NFkappaB. However, the mechanism(s) by which ROS regulate NFkappaB remain unclear and controversial. In the present report, we describe a mechanism whereby interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) stimulation of NFkappaB is partially regulated by H2O2-mediated activation of NIK and subsequent NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKalpha. IL-1beta induced H2O2 production in MCF-7 cells and clearance of this ROS through the expression of GPx-1 reduced NFkappaB transcriptional activation by inhibiting NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKalpha. Although IKKalpha and IKKbeta were both involved in IL-1beta-mediated activation of NFkappaB, only the IKKalpha-dependent component was modulated by changes in H2O2 levels. Interestingly, in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that NIK was activated by a very narrow range of H2O2 (1-10 microM), whereas higher concentrations (100 microM to 1 mM) inhibited NIK activity. Treatment of cells with the general Ser\/Thr phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid) lead to activation of NFkappaB and enhanced NIK activity as a IKKalpha kinase, suggesting that ROS may directly regulate NIK through the inhibition of phosphatases. Recruitment of NIK to TRAF6 following IL-1beta stimulation was inhibited by H2O2 clearance and Rac1 siRNA, suggesting that Rac-dependent NADPH oxidase may be a source of ROS required for NIK activation. In summary, our studies have demonstrated that redox regulation of NIK by H2O2 is mechanistically important in IL-1beta induction of NFkappaB activation.",
    "1032": "The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase MKP-1\/CL100\/DUSP1 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by p44\/42 MAPK (ERK1\/2) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering MKP-1 proteolysis. Active ERK2 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated MKP-1 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)\/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)\/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)\/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated MKP-1 proteolysis stimulated by MKK1-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)\/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 and the degradation of MKP-1. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 bound to SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Skp2 enhanced MKP-1 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Skp2 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous MKP-1 degradation rate in a Skp2-dependent manner. Thus, MKP-1 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and SCF(Skp2) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.",
    "2300": "The Neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) tumor suppressor merlin negatively regulates cell proliferation in numerous cell types. We have previously shown that the NF2 protein (merlin\/schwannomin) associates with mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase that is required for the proliferation of normal and neoplastic cells. In this study, we show that merlin inhibits MLK3 activity, as well as the activation of its downstream effectors, B-Raf, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The ability of merlin to regulate MLK3 activity requires a direct association between MLK3 and residues in the C-terminal region of merlin. Merlin integrates Rho GTPase family signaling with MAPK activity by inhibiting the binding between MLK3 and its upstream activator, Cdc42. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MLK3 is required for merlin-mediated suppression of cell proliferation and invasion. Collectively, these results establish merlin as a potent inhibitor of MLK3, ERK and JNK activation in cancer, and provide a mechanistic link between deregulated MAPK and Rho GTPase signaling in NF2 growth control.",
    "1911": "In Caenorhabditis elegans, fem-1, fem-2, and fem-3 play pivotal roles in sex determination. Recently, a mammalian homologue of the C. elegans sex-determining protein FEM-1, F1Aalpha, has been described. Although there is little evidence to link F1Aalpha to sex determination, F1Aalpha and FEM-1 both promote apoptosis in mammalian cells. Here we report the identification and characterization of a human homologue of the C. elegans sex-determining protein FEM-2, hFEM-2. Similar to FEM-2, hFEM-2 exhibited PP2C phosphatase activity and associated with FEM-3. hFEM-2 shows striking similarity (79% amino acid identity) to rat Ca(2+)\/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (rCaMKPase). hFEM-2 and FEM-2, but not PP2Calpha, were demonstrated to dephosphorylate CaM kinase II efficiently in vitro, suggesting that hFEM-2 and FEM-2 are specific phosphatases for CaM kinase. Furthermore, hFEM-2 and FEM-2 associated with F1Aalpha and FEM-1 respectively. Overexpression of hFEM-2, FEM-2, or rCaMKPase all mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells. The catalytically active, but not the inactive, forms of hFEM-2 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was blocked by Bcl-XL or a dominant negative mutant of caspase-9. Taken together, our data suggest that hFEM-2 and rCaMKPase are mammalian homologues of FEM-2 and they are evolutionarily conserved CaM kinase phosphatases that may have a role in apoptosis signaling.",
    "2796": "In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells initiate a complex signalling pathway, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence, which provides a barrier to tumour development, involves activation of the DDR. Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we have identified 17 factors required for oncogenic BRAF to induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes. One of these factors is an F-box protein, FBXO31, a candidate tumour suppressor encoded in 16q24.3, a region in which there is loss of heterozygosity in breast, ovarian, hepatocellular and prostate cancers. Here we study the cellular role of FBXO31, identify its target substrate and determine the basis for its growth inhibitory activity. We show that ectopic expression of FBXO31 acts through a proteasome-directed pathway to mediate the degradation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of progression from G1 to S phase, resulting in arrest in G1. Cyclin D1 degradation results from a direct interaction with FBXO31 and is dependent on the F-box motif of FBXO31 and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr 286, which is known to be required for cyclin D1 proteolysis. The involvement of the DDR in oncogene-induced senescence prompted us to investigate the role of FBXO31 in DNA repair. We find that DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation results in increased FBXO31 levels, which requires phosphorylation of FBXO31 by the DDR-initiating kinase ATM. RNAi-mediated knockdown of FBXO31 prevents cells from undergoing efficient arrest in G1 after gamma-irradiation and markedly increases sensitivity to DNA damage. Finally, we show that a variety of DNA damaging agents all result in a large increase in FBXO31 levels, indicating that induction of FBXO31 is a general response to genotoxic stress. Our results reveal FBXO31 as a regulator of the G1\/S transition that is specifically required for DNA damage-induced growth arrest.",
    "1308": "Sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) catalyzes cholic acid synthesis in the liver and is feedback inhibited by bile acids. In addition to activating farnesoid X receptor (nuclear receptor subfamily 1H4), bile acids also induce inflammatory cytokines in hepatocytes. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which inflammatory cytokines inhibit human CYP8B1 gene transcription. Real-time PCR assays revealed that both chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) markedly reduced CYP8B1, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase CYP7A1 and hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) mRNA expression levels in human primary hepatocytes. However, CDCA induced, but IL-1beta reduced, small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA expression. IL-1beta inhibited human CYP8B1 reporter activity only in liver cells, and a c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-specific inhibitor-blocked IL-1beta inhibition. Activated JNK1 or c-Jun inhibited, whereas their dominant negative forms blocked, IL-1beta inhibition of CYP8B1 transcription. Mutagenesis analyses mapped an IL-1beta response element to a previously identified bile acid response element, which contains an HNF4alpha binding site. A dominant negative HNF4alpha inhibited CYP8B1 gene transcription and ectopically expressed HNF4alpha blocked IL-1beta inhibition. Furthermore, IL-1beta inhibited HNF4alpha gene transcription, protein expression, and binding to the CYP8B1 gene. JNK1 phosphorylated HNF4alpha and a JNK-specific inhibitor blocked the IL-1beta inhibition of HNF4alpha expression. These results suggest that IL-1beta inhibits CYP8B1 gene transcription via a mitogen-activated protein kinase\/JNK pathway that inhibits HNF4alpha gene expression and its DNA-binding ability. This mechanism may play an important role in the adaptive response to inflammatory cytokines and in the protection of the liver during cholestasis.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate 'activated SRC-3 oncoprotein' turnover during tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), a cullin 3 (CUL3)-based ubiquitin ligase, is responsible for SRC-3 ubiquitination and proteolysis. SPOP interacts directly with an SRC-3 phospho-degron in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Casein kinase I\u025b phosphorylates the S102 in this degron and promotes SPOP-dependent turnover of SRC-3. Short hairpin RNA knockdown and overexpression experiments substantiated that the SPOP\/CUL3\/Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase complex promotes SRC-3 turnover. A systematic analysis of the SPOP genomic locus revealed that a high percentage of genomic loss or loss of heterozygosity occurs at this locus in breast cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoration of SPOP expression inhibited SRC-3-mediated oncogenic signaling and tumorigenesis, thus positioning SPOP as a tumor suppressor."

We show that mammalian P49427 is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated in proliferating cells. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the regulatory (beta) subunit of human casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a P49427-interacting protein and show that human P49427 interacts in vivo with P67870 in transfected cells. P49427 is specifically phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant CK2 and HeLa nuclear extract at five sites within the carboxyl-terminal 36 amino acids of P49427. Importantly, this phosphorylation is inhibited by heparin, a substrate-specific inhibitor of CK2. We have also identified a kinase activity associated with P49427 in proliferating cells, and we show that this kinase is sensitive to heparin and can utilize GTP, strongly suggesting it is CK2. Phosphorylation of P49427 by the associated kinase maps predominantly to residues 203 and 222. Mutation of P49427 at CK2-targeted residues, Ser-203, Ser-222, Ser-231, Thr-233, and Ser-236, abolishes the phosphorylation of P49427 observed in vivo and markedly shifts nuclearly localized P49427 to the cytoplasm. These results suggest a potential role for CK2-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of P49427 cell localization and function.",
    "2783": "Ca(2+) influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptor at excitatory synapses causes activation of post-synaptic Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (Q13555) and its translocation to the Q13224 subunit of NMDA receptor. The major binding site for Q13555 on Q13224 undergoes phosphorylation at Ser1303, in vivo. Even though some regulatory effects of this phosphorylation are known, the mode of dephosphorylation of Q13224-Ser1303 is still unclear. We show that phosphorylation status at Ser1303 enables Q13224 to distinguish between the Ca(2+)\/calmodulin activated form and the autonomously active Thr286-autophosphorylated form of Q13555. Green fluorescent protein-alpha-Q13555 co-expressed with Q13224 sequence in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was used to study intracellular binding between the two proteins. Binding in vitro was studied by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay. Thr286-autophosphorylated alpha-Q13555 or the autophosphorylation mimicking mutant, T286D-alpha-Q13555, binds Q13224 sequence independent of Ca(2+)\/calmodulin unlike native wild-type alpha-Q13555. We show enhancement of this binding by Ca(2+)\/calmodulin. Phosphorylation or a phosphorylation mimicking mutation on Q13224 (Q13224) abolishes the Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-independent binding whereas it allows the Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent binding of alpha-Q13555 in vitro. Similarly, the autonomously active mutants, T286D-alpha-Q13555 and F293E\/N294D-alpha-Q13555, exhibited Ca(2+)-independent binding to non-phosphorylatable mutant of Q13224 under intracellular conditions. We also show for the first time that phosphatases in the brain such as protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylate phospho-Ser1303 on Q13224.",
    "118": "The P04637 tumor suppressor is activated in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Transactivation of P04637 target genes dictates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or induction of apoptosis; however, a molecular mechanism responsible for these distinct functions remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of P04637 on Ser(46) was associated with induction of Q9HCN2 expression, resulting in the commitment of the cell fate into apoptotic cell death. Moreover, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, Q96A56 was expressed and recruited a kinase(s) to P04637 that specifically phosphorylated Ser(46). Here, we show that the pro-apoptotic kinase, Q05655 (Q05655), is involved in phosphorylation of P04637 on Ser(46). Q05655-mediated phosphorylation is required for the interaction of Q05655 with P04637. The results also demonstrate that Q96A56 associates with Q05655 upon exposure to genotoxic agents. Consistent with these results, Q05655 potentiates P04637-dependent apoptosis by Ser(46) phosphorylation in response to genotoxic stress. These findings indicate that Q05655 regulates P04637 to induce apoptotic cell death in the cellular response to DNA damage.",
    "2111": "The Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 protein antagonizes the early antiviral alpha\/beta interferon (P01562\/beta) response. We previously demonstrated that VP35 inhibits the virus-induced activation of the P01574 promoter by blocking the phosphorylation of Q14653 (Q14653), a transcription factor that is crucial for the induction of P01562\/beta expression. Furthermore, VP35 blocks P01574 promoter activation induced by any of several components of the O95786 (O95786)\/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (Q9BYX4)-activated signaling pathways including O95786, Q7Z434 (Q7Z434), Q9UHD2 (Q9UHD2), and Q14164 (Q14164). These results suggested that VP35 may target the IRF kinases Q9UHD2 and Q14164. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments now demonstrate physical interactions of VP35 with Q14164 and Q9UHD2, and the use of an Q14164 deletion construct further demonstrates that the amino-terminal kinase domain of Q14164 is sufficient for interactions with either Q14653 or VP35. In vitro, either Q14164 or Q9UHD2 phosphorylates not only Q14653 but also VP35. Moreover, VP35 overexpression impairs Q14164-Q14653, Q14164-Q92985, and Q14164-Q7Z434 interactions. Finally, lysates from cells overexpressing Q14164 contain kinase activity that can phosphorylate Q14653 in vitro. When VP35 is expressed in the Q14164-expressing cells, this kinase activity is suppressed. These data suggest that VP35 exerts its IFN-antagonist function, at least in part, by blocking necessary interactions between the kinases Q14164 and Q9UHD2 and their normal interaction partners, including their substrates, Q14653 and Q92985.",
    "1832": "The calcium\/calmodulin-dependent kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (O00418; O00418) is subject to multisite phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. Phosphorylation at Ser359 inhibits O00418 activity even at high calcium concentrations. To identify the kinase that phosphorylates Ser359 in O00418, we developed an extensive purification protocol. Tryptic mass fingerprint analysis identified it as P06493 (P06493). P06493 co-purifies with Ser359 kinase activity and P06493-cyclin B complexes phosphorylate O00418 at Ser359. We demonstrate that P06493 contributes to controlling P13639 phosphorylation in cells. P06493 is activated early in mitosis. Kinase activity against Ser359 in O00418 also peaks at this stage of the cell cycle and P13639 phosphorylation is low in mitotic cells. Inactivation of O00418 by P06493 may serve to keep P13639 active during mitosis (where calcium levels rise) and thereby permit protein synthesis to proceed in mitotic cells. Amino-acid starvation decreases P06493's activity against O00418, whereas loss of P49815 (a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1)) increases it. These data closely match the control of Ser359 phosphorylation and indicate that P06493 may be regulated by mTORC1.",
    "576": "In HEK293 cells, transfected with the Ca2+ channel protein Q9H1D0, Ca2+ influx is increased and Q9H1D0 is tyrosine phosphorylated following addition of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor N,N-dimethyl-hydroxamido hydroxovanadate to cells. This effect of DMHV is enhanced by co-transfection of cells with the tyrosine kinase P12931 and the tyrosine phosphatase 1B. It is abolished when cells had been treated with Q15181, an inhibitor of P12931 family tyrosine kinases. P18031 interacts with the N-terminal domain of Q9H1D0 within a region of amino acids 1-191 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and the yeast 2-hybrid system. Point mutation of both tyrosines 161 and 162 in the Q9H1D0 protein abolishes the DMHV-effect on Ca2+ influx and tyrosine phosphorylation by P12931. Single mutations of Y161 or Y162 shows that each of both tyrosines alone is sufficient for the DMHV-effect. We conclude that phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation of tyrosines in position 161 and 162 is essential for regulation of Ca2+ influx through Q9H1D0 Ca2+ channels in HEK293 cells.",
    "42": "To gain insight into the function of human P51817 (P51817), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, Q92917 and O43541 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between P51817 and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between O43541 and P51817 was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that P51817 phosphorylates O43541 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of P51817 phosphorylation. Both P51817 and O43541 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where P51817 levels are induced and O43541 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of O43541 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation O43541 displays an increased binding to the human P10451, Q02363, and Q03014 gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both O43541 and P51817 proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.",
    "628": "Previous reports have suggested that human P01730(+) P01589(hi)Q9BZS1-1(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) have functional plasticity and may differentiate into effector T cells under inflammation. The molecular mechanisms underlying these findings remain unclear. Here we identified the residue serine 422 of human Q9BZS1-1 as a phosphorylation site that regulates its function, which is not present in murine Q9BZS1-1. P11309-2 kinase, which is highly expressed in human Tregs, was found to be able to interact with and to phosphorylate human Q9BZS1-1 at serine 422. T cell receptor (TCR) signaling inhibits P11309-2 induction, whereas P05231 promotes P11309-2 expression in in vitro expanded human Tregs. P11309-2 negatively regulates Q9BZS1-1 chromatin binding activity by specifically phosphorylating Q9BZS1-1 at Ser(422). Our data also suggest that phosphorylation of Q9BZS1-1 at the Ser(418) site could prevent Q9BZS1-1 phosphorylation at Ser(422) mediated by P11309-2. Knockdown of P11309-2 in in vitro expanded human Tregs promoted Q9BZS1-1-induced target gene expression, including P01589, P16410, and Q9Y5U5 (Q9Y5U5), or weakened Q9BZS1-1-suppressed P60568 gene expression and enhanced the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. Furthermore, P11309-2-specific inhibitor boosted Q9BZS1-1 DNA binding activity in in vitro expanded primary Tregs and also enhanced their suppressive activity toward the proliferation of T effector cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that P11309-2 could be a new potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of human-specific autoimmune diseases because of its ability to modulate the immunosuppressive activity of human Tregs.

    "485": "Q9BZS1 is a transcription factor required for the development of regulatory T cells (Treg). Mice and humans with a loss of Q9BZS1 function suffer from uncontrolled autoimmunity and inflammatory disease. Expression of Q9BZS1 is necessary for the anti-inflammatory capacity of Treg, but whether Q9BZS1 activity is further subject to regulation by extracellular signals is unclear. The primary structure of Q9BZS1 contains four cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) motifs (Ser\/Thr-Pro) within the N-terminal repressor domain, and we show that P24941 can partner with cyclin E to phosphorylate Q9BZS1 at these sites. Consistent with our previous demonstration that P24941 negatively regulates Treg function, we find that mutation of the serine or threonine at each CDK motif to alanine (S\/TA) results in enhanced Q9BZS1 protein stability in CD4(+) T cells. T cells expressing the S\/TA mutant of Q9BZS1 showed enhanced induction (e.g. P01589) and repression (e.g. P60568) of canonical Q9BZS1-responsive genes, exhibited an increased capacity to suppress conventional T cell proliferation in vitro, and were highly effective at ameliorating colitis in an in vivo model of inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicate that P24941 negatively regulates the stability and activity of Q9BZS1 and implicate CDK-coupled receptor signal transduction in the control of regulatory T cell function and stability.

    "1483": "Involvement of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (P42768) in promoting cell activation requires its release from autoinhibitory structural constraints and has been attributed to P42768 association with activated P60953. Here, however, we show that T cell development and T cell receptor (TCR)-induced proliferation and actin polymerization proceed normally in P42768-\/- mice expressing a P42768 transgene lacking the P60953 binding domain. By contrast, mutation of tyrosine residue Y291, identified here as the major site of TCR-induced P42768 tyrosine phosphorylation, abrogated induction of P42768 tyrosine phosphorylation and its effector activities, including nuclear factor of activated T cell transcriptional activity, actin polymerization, and immunological synapse formation. TCR-induced P42768 tyrosine phosphorylation P42768 also disrupted in T cells lacking P06241, a kinase shown here to bind, colocalize with, and phosphorylate P42768. By contrast, P42768 P42768 tyrosine dephosphorylated by Q9Y2R2 (PTP)-PEST, a tyrosine phosphatase shown here to interact with P42768 via proline, serine, threonine phosphatase interacting protein (O43586 binding. Although P06241 enhanced P42768-mediated P61160\/3 activation and P42768 required for synapse formation, Q05209 combined with O43586 inhibited P42768-driven actin polymerization and synapse formation. These observations identify key roles for P06241 and Q05209 in regulating P42768 and imply that inducible P42768 tyrosine phosphorylation can occur independently of P60953 binding, but unlike the P60953 interaction, is absolutely required for P42768 contributions to T cell activation.",
    "2730": "Glucocorticoid resistance is a major driver of therapeutic failure in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we identify the P31749 kinase as a major negative regulator of the P04150 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, P31749 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of P04150 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced P04150 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of P60484 and consequent P31749 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced P04150 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.",
    "3200": "The adipocyte-rich microenvironment forms a niche for ovarian cancer metastasis, but the mechanisms driving this process are incompletely understood. Here we show that Q9H0K1 (Q9H0K1) is overexpressed in adipocyte-rich metastatic deposits compared with ovarian primary lesions. Overexpression of Q9H0K1 in ovarian cancer cells promotes abdominal metastasis while Q9H0K1 depletion prevents metastasis invivo. Importantly, adipocytes induce calcium-dependent activation and autophosphorylation of Q9H0K1. Activated Q9H0K1 plays a dual role in augmenting P54646-induced phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in activating the PI3K\/P31749 pathway through O00459-S154 phosphorylation. These findings identify Q9H0K1 at the apex of the adipocyte-induced signaling cascades in cancer cells and make a compelling case for targeting Q9H0K1 for therapy in ovarian cancer.",
    "1028": "The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase P28562\/P28562\/P28562 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by Q8TCB0\/42 MAPK (5595;5594) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering P28562 proteolysis. Active P28482 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated P28562 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)\/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)\/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)\/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated P28562 proteolysis stimulated by Q02750-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)\/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) P28562 and the degradation of P28562. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) P28562 bound to P21583(Q13309) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Q13309 enhanced P28562 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Q13309 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous P28562 degradation rate in a Q13309-dependent manner. Thus, P28562 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and P21583(Q13309) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.",
    "2253": "P46527 controls cell proliferation by binding to and regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Here we show that Cdk inhibition and O60232 stability are regulated through direct phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. A conserved tyrosine residue (Y88) in the Cdk-binding domain of O60232 can be phosphorylated by the Src-family kinase P07948 and the oncogene product P00519. Y88 phosphorylation does not prevent O60232 binding to P20248\/P24941. Instead, it causes phosphorylated Y88 and the entire inhibitory 3(10)-helix of O60232 to be ejected from the P24941 active site, thus restoring partial Cdk activity. Importantly, this allows Y88-phosphorylated O60232 to be efficiently phosphorylated on threonine 187 by P24941 which in turn promotes its P21583-Q13309-dependent degradation. This direct link between transforming tyrosine kinases and O60232 may provide an explanation for Cdk kinase activities observed in O60232 complexes and for premature O60232 elimination in cells that have been transformed by activated tyrosine kinases.",

Expression of Q12913 is enhanced at high cell density, and this observation suggests that Q12913 may function in the regulation of cell adhesion and possibly contact inhibition of cell growth. In order to investigate the function of Q12913, substrate-trapping mutants of the phosphatase were used to identify potential substrates. GST-fusion proteins containing the Q12913 catalytic domain with a substrate-trapping D\/A mutation were found to interact with O60716(ctn), a component of adherens junctions. Q12913 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including P35222 and gamma-catenin. The interaction with O60716(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and P12830 expression. Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases Q05209, P08575, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of Q12913 with these proteins is specific. Q12913 expression was concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in A549 cells. O60716(ctn) was found to colocalize with these structures. Together these data suggest an important role for Q12913 in the function of cell-cell contacts and adherens junctions.",

Here we found that P13232-P52333 signals activated the transcription factor O95644 in DN thymocytes by phosphorylating Tyr371 in the regulatory region of O95644. This NFAT-activation pathway was critical for the survival and development of DN thymocytes, as deficiency in O95644 blocked thymocyte development at the 28487 stage, leading to T cell lymphopenia. In addition, our results demonstrated a cooperative function for O95644 and P42229 in guiding thymocyte development in response to P13232 signals.",

Q9Y2R2 (Q9Y2R2), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of Q9Y2R2. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of Q9Y2R2. These included three novel Q9Y2R2 substrates (P15498, P07766, and P55072) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of Q9Y2R2 (P06239 and P43403). 6962 (6962) zeta was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S interacted directly with activated P06239, P43403, and TCRzeta, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native Q9Y2R2 dephosphorylated P06239 and P43403 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (P06239) or Tyr-319 (P43403). Native Q9Y2R2 also dephosphorylated TCRzeta in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRzeta when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRzeta as a direct substrate of Q9Y2R2.",
    "3003": "The effect of Q5S007 (Q5S007) mutation I2020T on its kinase activity has been controversial, with both increased and decreased effects being reported. We conducted steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic studies on LRRKtide and its analog LRRKtide(S). Their phosphorylation differs by the rate-limiting steps: product release is rate-limiting for LRRKtide and phosphoryl transfer is rate-limiting for LRRKtide(S). As a result, we observed that the I2020T mutant is more active than wild type (WT) Q5S007 for LRRKtide(S) phosphorylation, whereas it is less active than WT for LRRKtide phosphorylation. Our pre-steady-state kinetic data suggest that (i) the I2020T mutant accelerates the rates of phosphoryl transfer of both reactions by 3-7-fold; (ii) this increase is masked by a rate-limiting product release step for LRRKtide phosphorylation; and (iii) the observed lower activity of the mutant for LRRKtide phosphorylation is a consequence of its instability: the concentration of the active form of the mutant is 3-fold lower than WT. The I2020T mutant has a dramatically low KATP and therefore leads to resistance to ATP competitive inhibitors. Two well known DFG-out or type II inhibitors are also weaker toward the mutant because they inhibit the mutant in an unexpected ATP competitive mechanism. The I2020 residue lies next to the DYG motif of the activation loop of the Q5S007 kinase domain. Our modeling and metadynamic simulations suggest that the I2020T mutant stabilizes the DYG-in active conformation and creates an unusual allosteric pocket that can bind type II inhibitors but in an ATP competitive fashion.

    "1111": "Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an essential role in antigen receptor-initiated lymphocyte activation. Their activity is largely regulated by a negative regulatory tyrosine which is a substrate for the activating action of the P08575 phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) or, conversely, the suppressing action of the cytosolic P41240 Q14289. Here we report that P08575 was phosphorylated by P41240 on two tyrosine residues, one of them identified as Tyr-1193. This residue was not phosphorylated by T-cell PTKs P06239 and P06241. Tyr-1193 was phosphorylated in intact T cells, and phosphorylation increased upon treatment with PTPase inhibitors, indicating that this tyrosine is a target for a constitutively active Q14289. Cotransfection of P08575 and P41240 into COS-1 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of P08575 in the intact cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated P08575 bound P06239 through the SH2 domain of the kinase. Finally, P41240-mediated phosphorylation of P08575 caused a severalfold increase in its PTPase activity. Our results show that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of P08575 can affect its activity and association with Src family PTKs and that this phosphorylation could be mediated by P41240. If this is also true in the intact cells, it adds a new dimension to the physiological function of P41240 in T lymphocytes.",

However, the regulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis is not completely understood. We show that the atypical secretory kinase family with sequence similarity 20, member B (O75063) phosphorylates the initiating xylose residue in the proteoglycan tetrasaccharide linkage region, and that this event functions as a molecular switch to regulate subsequent glycosaminoglycan assembly. Proteoglycans from O75063 knockout cells contain a truncated tetrasaccharide linkage region consisting of a disaccharide capped with sialic acid (Sia2-3Gal1-4Xyl1) that cannot be further elongated. We also show that the activity of Q96L58 (Q96L58, Q96L58), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide linkage region, is dramatically increased by O75063-dependent xylose phosphorylation. Inactivating mutations in the Q96L58 gene (Q96L58) associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cause proteoglycan maturation defects similar to O75063 deletion. Collectively, our findings suggest that Q96L58 function is impaired by loss of O75063-dependent xylose phosphorylation and reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism for regulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis.

CHX and flavopiridol-induced dephosphorylation of pocket proteins is attributable to inactivation of D-type P12004\/CDKs and G(1)\/S CDKs, respectively, which unmasks a phosphatase activity that targets the three pocket proteins apparently throughout the cell cycle. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors at concentrations selective for Q15257 inhibition prevents CHX and flavopiridol-mediated dephosphorylation of pocket proteins in vivo. Also, ectopic expression of SV40 small t antigen, which inhibits Q15257 via disruption of trimeric Q15257 holoenzymes, delays CHX-induced pocket protein dephosphorylation. Moreover, dephosphorylation of Q08999 and P28749 in cell extracts is inhibited by concentrations of okadaic acid known to inhibit Q15257, but not Q15181. Finally, the P67775 (5515;5524) specifically interacts with both Q08999 and P28749 in quiescent cells as well as cells progressing throughout the cell cycle. Together, these results demonstrate that the overall phosphorylation state of pocket proteins is determined, at least in part, by a dynamic equilibrium between CDKs and Q15257, or a closely related Q15257-like enzyme. These findings have important implications, as cell cycle or checkpoint-dependent inhibition of CDK activities counteracted by an active Q15257 should have imminent effects on the phosphorylation state and activities of pocket proteins.",
    "534": "P35236 (P35236)\/hemopoietic Q92729 is a human cytoplasmic Q92729 that is predominantly expressed in the hemopoietic cells. Recently, it was reported that hemopoietic Q92729 inhibited TCR-mediated signal transduction. However, the precise mechanism of the inhibition was not identified. Here we report that P28482 (P28482) is the direct target of P35236. P35236 dephosphorylated P28482 in vitro. Expression of wild-type P35236 in 293T cells suppressed the phosphorylation of P28482 by a mutant Q02750, which was constitutively active regardless of upstream activation signals. No suppression of the phosphorylation was observed by LC-PTPCS, a catalytically inactive mutant. In Jurkat cells, P35236 suppressed the P28482 and P28482 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. P35236 and LC-PTPCS made complexes with P27361, P28482, and Q16539, but not with the gain-of-function sevenmaker P28482 mutant (D321N). A small deletion (aa 1-46) in the N-terminal portion of P35236 or Arg to Ala substitutions at aa 41 and 42 resulted in the loss of P28482 binding activity. These P35236 mutants revealed little inhibition of the P28482 cascade activated by TCR cross-linking. On the other hand, the wild-type P35236 did not suppress the phosphorylation of sevenmaker P28482 mutant. Thus, the complex formation of P35236 with P28482 is the essential mechanism for the suppression. Taken collectively, these results indicate that P35236 suppresses mitogen-activated protein kinase directly in vivo.",
    "649": "We have recently shown that P18031 (P18031) associates with the docking protein Q61140 in 3Y1 rat fibroblasts. This interaction is mediated by a proline-rich sequence on P18031 and the SH3 domain on Q61140. Expression of wild-type P18031 (WT-P18031), but not a catalytically competent, proline-to-alanine point mutant that cannot bind Q61140 (PA-P18031), causes substantial tyrosine dephosphorylation of Q61140 (F. Liu, D. E. Hill, and J. Chernoff, J. Biol. Chem. 271:31290-31295, 1996). Here we demonstrate that WT-, but not PA-P18031, inhibits transformation of rat 3Y1 fibroblasts by v-P46108, -P12931, and -ras, but not by v-raf. These effects on transformation correlate with the phosphorylation status of Q61140 and two proteins that are associated with Q61140, P49023 and Q05397. Expression of WT-P18031 reduces formation of Q61140-P46108 complexes and inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by P12931 and P46108. These data show that transformation suppression by P18031 requires a functional SH3 ligand and suggest that Q61140 may represent an important physiological target of P18031 in cells.",
    "482": "The tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway controls tissue homeostasis through balancing cell proliferation and apoptosis. Activation of the kinases P26927 and Q13188 (6788;4485) is a key upstream event in this pathway and remains poorly understood. 6788;4485 and their critical regulators RASSFs contain Salvador\/RASSF1A\/Hippo (SARAH) domains that can homo- and heterodimerize. Here, we report the crystal structures of human Q13188 alone and bound to Q8WWW0. Q13188 undergoes activation through transautophosphorylation at its activation loop, which requires SARAH-mediated homodimerization. Q8WWW0 disrupts Q13188 homodimer and blocks Q13188 autoactivation. Binding of Q8WWW0 to already activated Q13188, however, does not inhibit its kinase activity. Thus, Q8WWW0 can act as an inhibitor or a potential positive regulator of Q13188, depending on whether it binds to Q13188 before or after activation-loop phosphorylation. We propose that these temporally sensitive functions of RASSFs enable the Hippo pathway to respond to and integrate diverse cellular signals.",
    "1371": "We and others previously identified P43699, also known as P43699 and Q15361, as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinomas. Here we show that P43699 induces the expression of the Q01973 (Q01973), which in turn sustains a favorable balance between prosurvival PI3K-AKT and pro-apoptotic P28482 signaling, in part through Q01973 kinase-dependent P12931 activation, as well as kinase activity-independent sustainment of the P00533-P21860 association, P21860 phosphorylation, and consequential PI3K activation. Notably, Q01973 knockdown effectively inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, irrespective of their P00533 status, including those with resistance to the P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Our findings thus identify Q01973 as an \"Achilles' heel\" in lung adenocarcinoma, warranting future development of therapeutic strategies for this devastating cancer.",
    "1135": "Indiscriminately suppressing total P45983 (P45983) activity is not an appropriate strategy because each P45983 appears to have a distinct function in cancer, asthma, diabetes, or Parkinson's disease. Herein, we report that 7-(6-N-phenylaminohexyl)amino-2H-anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6-one (AV-7) inhibited P45983 activity, but not P45984 or P53779. We found that ultraviolet B (UVB) induced P05412 phosphorylation and sub-G1 accumulation in P45984(-\/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts, which contain an abundance of P45983, but not P45984. These results demonstrate that AV-7 is an isoform selective small-molecule inhibitor of P45983 activity, which might be developed as a therapeutic against diabetes.",
    "2751": "The enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the control of several metabolic enzymes and transcription factors in response to extracellular signals. In the past, the enzyme has been considered to be a protein Ser\/Thr kinase although it was recently reported to contain Tyr(P) (Hughes, K., Nikolakaki, E., Plyte, S. E., Totty, N. F., and Woodgett, J. R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 803-808). A cDNA encoding rabbit skeletal muscle P49841 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as an active protein kinase, with apparent M(r) 46,000, capable of phosphorylating several known GSK-3 substrates. Recombinant P49841 autophosphorylated on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues although the enzyme already contained Tyr(P) as judged by its recognition by anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. The net result of the autophosphorylation was a 3-5-fold reduction in enzyme activity. P49840, purified from rabbit muscle, also underwent autophosphorylation but only on Ser and Thr residues. In this case, the autophosphorylation stabilized the enzyme activity compared with the control lacking ATP\/Mg2+. Of several phosphatases tested, the lambda-phage phosphatase was the most effective in dephosphorylating at Ser and Thr residues but did not dephosphorylate at Tyr residues. The action of the lambda-phosphatase caused a reactivation of P49841 to approximately 80% of the starting activity. The protein tyrosine phosphatase P18031 was able to dephosphorylate at Tyr residues leading to a reduction in enzyme activity. A truncated form of P49841, apparent M(r) 40,000, had a significantly higher specific activity, was defective in autophosphorylation, and was not inactivated in the autophosphorylation reaction. We conclude that P49841 is a dual specificity protein kinase in the same sense as the mitogen-activated protein kinase\/ERK family of enzymes. Phosphorylation at different residues differentially controls enzyme activity, Ser\/Thr phosphorylation causing inactivation and Tyr phosphorylation resulting in increased activity.",
    "2187": "Short-patch repair of DNA single-strand breaks and gaps (P05455) is coordinated by P18887, a scaffold protein that recruits the DNA polymerase and DNA ligase required for filling and sealing the damaged strand. P18887 can also recruit end-processing enzymes, such as Q96T60 (Q96T60), Q7Z2E3 and Q8IW19 (Q8IW19), which ensure the availability of a free 3'-hydroxyl on one side of the gap, and a 5'-phosphate group on the other, for the polymerase and ligase reactions respectively. Q96T60 binds to a phosphorylated segment of P18887 (between its two C-terminal BRCT domains) via its Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. We show here, contrary to previous studies, that the FHA domain of Q96T60 binds specifically, and with high affinity to a multiply phosphorylated motif in P18887 containing a pSer-pThr dipeptide, and forms a 2:1 Q96T60:P18887 complex. The high-resolution crystal structure of a Q96T60-FHA-P18887 phosphopeptide complex reveals the basis for this unusual bis-phosphopeptide recognition, which is probably a common feature of the known P18887-associating end-processing enzymes.",
    "330": "Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) Q09472 and Q92793 (Q92793) function as co-activators for a variety of sequence-specific transcription factors, including Q01196. Here, we report that Q9H2X6 (Q9H2X6) forms a complex with Q01196 and Q09472, and phosphorylates both Q01196 and Q09472 to stimulate transcription activation as well as HAT activities. Phosphorylation of Q09472 is triggered by phosphorylated Q01196 as well as by P17947, P10242, P05412 and P01100, and is inhibited by dominant-negative Q9H2X6. Phosphorylation of Q09472 and Q01196 is impaired in 204851;28996 double-deficient mouse embryos. Double-deficient mice exhibit defects in primitive\/definitive hematopoiesis, vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and neural tube closure. These phenotypes are in part similar to those observed in Q09472- and Q92793-deficient mice. Q9H2X6 also phosphorylates another co-activator, Q92794, in an Q01196-dependent manner. We discuss a possible mechanism by which transcription factors could regulate local histone acetylation and transcription of their target genes.",
    "65": "Nuclear retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RARs) activate gene expression through dynamic interactions with coregulators in coordination with the ligand and phosphorylation processes. Here we show that during RA-dependent activation of the P10276 isotype, the Q9BQG0 coactivator pCIP\/Q9Y6Q9\/Q9Y6Q9\/P60763\/Q15629\/Q9Y6Q9 is phosphorylated by p38MAPK. Q9Y6Q9 phosphorylation has been correlated to an initial facilitation of P10276-target genes activation, via the control of the dynamics of the interactions of the coactivator with P10276. Then, phosphorylation inhibits transcription via promoting the degradation of Q9Y6Q9. In line with this, inhibition of p38MAPK markedly enhances P10276-mediated transcription and RA-dependent induction of cell differentiation. Q9Y6Q9 phosphorylation and degradation occur only within the context of P10276 complexes, suggesting that the P10276 isotype defines a phosphorylation code through dictating the accessibility of the coactivator to p38MAPK. We propose a model in which P10276 transcriptional activity is regulated by Q9Y6Q9 through coordinated events that are fine-tuned by RA and p38MAPK.",
    "123": "D-sites are a class of MAPK-docking sites that have been found in many MAPK regulators and substrates. A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) Q02750, P36507, P46734, P45985, and P52564. Here we demonstrated that O14733 recognizes its target P45983-1 by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of O14733. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind P45983-1 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length O14733 containing combined D1\/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to P45983-1 and exhibited reduced P45983-1 kinase activity when compared with wild-type O14733. Peptide versions of the D-sites from P45985 or the Q9UQF2 scaffold protein inhibited O14733-P45983-1 binding, suggesting that all three P45983-1 regulators bind to the same region of P45983-1. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of O14733 inhibited the ability of P45983-1 and P45984 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates P05412 and P15336, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with O14733 for docking to P45983-1. Finally, O14733-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of P45983-1 versus P28482. We conclude that O14733 contains three P45983-1-docking sites that interact to selectively bind P45983-1 and contribute to P45983-1 signal transmission and specificity.",
    "732": "Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by inflammatory cytokines involves the successive action of Q99558 (Q99558) and two IkappaB kinases, O15111 and O14920. Here we show that Q99558 preferentially phosphorylates O15111 over O14920, leading to the activation of O15111 kinase activity. This phosphorylation of O15111 occurs specifically on Ser-176 in the activation loop between kinase subdomains VII and P10176. A mutant form of O15111 containing alanine at residue 176 cannot be phosphorylated or activated by Q99558 and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of interleukin 1- and tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-kappaB activation. Conversely, a mutant form of O15111 containing glutamic acid at residue 176 is constitutively active. Thus, the phosphorylation of O15111 on Ser-176 by Q99558 may be required for cytokine-mediated NF-kappaB activation.",
    "1462": "O43426 is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase concentrated in presynaptic nerve terminals, where it dephosphorylates a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling. Like other proteins with a role in endocytosis, O43426 undergoes constitutive phosphorylation in resting synapses and stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation by calcineurin. Here, we show that Q00535 (Q00535) phosphorylates O43426 and regulates its function both in vitro and in intact synaptosomes. Q00535 phosphorylation inhibited the inositol 5-phosphatase activity of O43426, whereas dephosphorylation by calcineurin stimulated such activity. The activity of O43426 was also stimulated by its interaction with Q99962, its major binding partner at the synapse. Notably, Q00535 phosphorylated serine 1144, which is adjacent to the endophilin binding site. Mutation of serine 1144 to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation by Q00535 inhibited the interaction of O43426 with Q99962. These results suggest that Q00535 and calcineurin may have an antagonistic role in the regulation of O43426 recruitment and activity, and therefore in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate turnover at synapses.",
    "1209": "Q8WUM4\/Q8WUM4 is an adaptor protein involved in regulating the function of receptor and cytoskeleton-associated tyrosine kinases. Here, we investigated its interaction with and regulation by P12931. Tyr319 of Q8WUM4 bound the isolated P12931 homology-2 (SH2) domain and was necessary for interaction with intact P12931. A proline-rich region in the C terminus of Q8WUM4 bound the P12931 SH3 domain, but this interaction was dependent on the release of the P12931 SH2 domain from its P12931 internal ligand either by interaction with Q8WUM4 Tyr319 or by mutation of P12931 Tyr527. P12931 phosphorylated Q8WUM4 at a C-terminal region rich in tyrosines, an activity that was stimulated by the presence of the Q8WUM4 binding partner SETA\/Q96B97. Phosphorylation of Q8WUM4 by P12931 caused it to translocate from the membrane and cytoskeleton to the cytoplasm and reduced its interaction with binding partners SETA\/Q96B97, P00533, and Q14289. As a consequence of this, P12931 antagonized the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase internalization and cell adhesion by Q8WUM4. We propose a model whereby P12931 antagonizes the effects of Q8WUM4 by phosphorylation of its C terminus, leading to the disruption of interactions with target proteins.",
    "2820": "Upon P41159 binding, the P41159 receptor is activated, leading to stimulation of the JAK\/STAT signal transduction cascade. The transient character of the tyrosine phosphorylation of O60674 and P40763 suggests the involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as negative regulators of this signalling pathway. Specifically, recent evidence has suggested that P18031 might be a key regulator of P41159 signalling, based on the resistance to diet-induced obesity and increased P41159 signalling observed in P18031-deficient mice. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism by which P18031 mediates the cessation of the P41159 signal transduction. P41159-induced activation of a P40763 responsive reporter was dose-dependently inhibited by co-transfection with P18031. No inhibition was observed when a catalytically inactive mutant of P18031 was used or when other PTPs were co-transfected. P18031 was able to dephosphorylate activated O60674 and P40763 in vitro, whereas either no or a minimal effect was observed with cluster of differentiation 45 (P08575), P18433 and P10586. By utilisation of a selective P18031 inhibitor, the P41159-induced P40763 activation was enhanced in cells. In conclusion, these results suggested that the negative regulatory role of P18031 on P41159 signalling is mediated through a direct and selective dephosphorylation of the two signalling molecules, O60674 and P40763.",
    "2998": "Maintenance of chromosomal stability relies on coordination between various processes that are critical for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Here we show that P33981 (P33981) kinase, which is essential for the mitotic checkpoint, also controls correction of improper chromosome attachments. We report that Q53HL2\/DasraB, a member of the complex that regulates the Q96GD4 kinase, is directly phosphorylated by P33981 on residues that are crucial for Q96GD4 activity and chromosome alignment. As a result, cells lacking P33981 kinase activity fail to efficiently align chromosomes due to impaired Q96GD4 function at centromeres, leaving improper attachments uncorrected. Strikingly, Q53HL2\/DasraB bearing phosphomimetic mutations restores Q96GD4 activity and alignment in P33981-depleted cells. P33981 thus coordinates attachment error correction and checkpoint signaling, two crucial responses to unproductive chromosome attachments.",
    "910": "The activation of P19838 has been shown to be regulated by multiple phosphorylations of IkappaBs and the P19838 Q04206 subunit. Here, we characterized the intracellular signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of Q04206 on Ser-536 using a novel anti-phospho-Q04206 (Ser-536) antibody. The Ser-536 of endogenous Q04206 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of P19838 stimulants including P01375 in the cytoplasm and rapidly dephosphorylated in the nucleus. The P01375-but not P01584-induced Ser-536 phosphorylation was severely impaired in murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from traf2-\/-traf5-\/- mice. Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IkappaB phosphorylation, inhibited the P01375-induced phosphorylation in vivo. In addition, overexpression of O43318 (O43318), O15111 and O14920 stimulated the phosphorylation, and their dominant negative mutants blocked the P01375-induced phosphorylation. Moreover, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against O43318, O15111 and O14920 blocked the phosphorylation of endogenous Q04206. On the other hand, calyculin-A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, blocked the dephosphorylation in the nucleus in vivo. These results indicate that similar signaling pathways were utilized for the phosphorylations of P25963 and Q04206, which further support the idea that both IkappaB and P19838 are substrates for the IKK complex in the activation of P19838.",

At the DNA damage checkpoint, some subtypes of P27348 and zeta isoforms in mammalian cells and O75943 in fission yeast) bind to Ser345-phosphorylated O14757 and promote its nuclear retention. Here, we report that P61981 forms a complex with O14757 phosphorylated at Ser296, but not at Q13535 sites (Ser317 and Ser345). Ser296 phosphorylation is catalysed by O14757 itself after O14757 phosphorylation by Q13535, and then Q13535 sites are rapidly dephosphorylated on Ser296-phosphorylated O14757. Although Ser345 phosphorylation is observed at nuclear DNA damage foci, it occurs more diffusely in the nucleus. The replacement of endogenous O14757 with O14757 mutated at Ser296 to Ala induces premature mitotic entry after ultraviolet irradiation, suggesting the importance of Ser296 phosphorylation in the DNA damage response. Although Ser296 phosphorylation induces the only marginal change in O14757 catalytic activity, P61981 mediates the interaction between O14757 and P30304. This ternary complex formation has an essential function in P30304 phosphorylation and degradation to block premature mitotic entry after DNA damage.",
    "2416": "Q9NY61 is a RNA polymerase II-binding protein involved in the transcription of E2F target genes and induction of cell proliferation. Here we show that Q9NY61 contributes to DNA damage response and that its depletion sensitizes cells to anticancer agents. The checkpoint kinases ATM\/ATR and O96017 interact with Q9NY61 and promote its phosphorylation and accumulation in response to DNA damage. These Q9NY61 modifications induce a specific recruitment of Q9NY61 on the P04637 and 644914 promoters. Interestingly, it has a profound effect on the basal expression of P04637, which is preserved following DNA damage. Notably, Q9NY61 contributes to the maintenance of the G2\/M checkpoint induced by DNA damage. These findings identify a mechanism by which checkpoint kinases regulate responses to DNA damage.",
    "1815": "The serine\/threonine kinase P11309-2 is known to promote cell cycle progression and to inhibit apoptosis leading to tumorigenesis. However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We show, herein, that all the P11309-2 family members (P11309-2, Q9P1W9, and Q86V86) bind to and directly phosphorylate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P40305(P46527) at threonine-157 and threonine-198 residues in cells and in vitro. The P11309-2-mediated phosphorylation induced P40305(P46527) binding to 14-3-3 protein, resulting in its nuclear export and proteasome-dependent degradation. Ectopic expression of P11309-2 kinases overcome the G(1) arrest mediated by wild-type P40305(P46527) but not by phosphorylation-resistant T157A-P40305(P46527) or T198A-P40305(P46527). In addition to the posttranslational regulations, P40305(P46527) promoter assay revealed that P11309-2 kinases also had the ability to suppress P40305(P46527) transcription. P11309-2-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of forkhead transcription factors, Q12778 and O43524, was involved in the transcriptional repression of the P40305(P46527) gene. In contrast, inhibition of P11309-2 signaling by expressing the dominant-negative form of P11309-2 increased nuclear P40305(P46527) level and attenuated cell proliferation. Because the CDK inhibitor P40305(P46527) plays a crucial role in tumor suppression by inhibiting abnormal cell cycle progression, P11309-2 kinases promote cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis by down-regulating P40305(P46527) expression at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels.",
    "2343": "The adipocyte-rich microenvironment forms a niche for ovarian cancer metastasis, but the mechanisms driving this process are incompletely understood. Here we show that Q9H0K1 (Q9H0K1) is overexpressed in adipocyte-rich metastatic deposits compared with ovarian primary lesions. Overexpression of Q9H0K1 in ovarian cancer cells promotes abdominal metastasis while Q9H0K1 depletion prevents metastasis invivo. Importantly, adipocytes induce calcium-dependent activation and autophosphorylation of Q9H0K1. Activated Q9H0K1 plays a dual role in augmenting P54646-induced phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in activating the PI3K\/P31749 pathway through O00459-S154 phosphorylation. These findings identify Q9H0K1 at the apex of the adipocyte-induced signaling cascades in cancer cells and make a compelling case for targeting Q9H0K1 for therapy in ovarian cancer.",
    "3143": "Dysfunction and loss of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells represent hallmarks of diabetes mellitus. Here, we show that mice lacking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Q16539delta display improved glucose tolerance due to enhanced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Deletion of O15264 results in pronounced activation of Q15139 (Q15139), the latter of which we have identified as a pivotal regulator of stimulated insulin exocytosis. O15264 catalyzes an inhibitory phosphorylation of Q15139, thereby attenuating stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, O15264 null mice are protected against high-fat-feeding-induced insulin resistance and oxidative stress-mediated beta cell failure. Inhibition of Q15139 reverses enhanced insulin secretion from O15264-deficient islets and glucose tolerance in O15264 null mice as well as their susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, the O15264-Q15139 pathway integrates regulation of the insulin secretory capacity and survival of pancreatic beta cells, pointing to a pivotal role for this pathway in the development of overt diabetes mellitus.",
    "1058": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated to act as second messengers in a number of signal transduction pathways, including P19838. However, the mechanism(s) by which ROS regulate P19838 remain unclear and controversial. In the present report, we describe a mechanism whereby P01584 (P01584) stimulation of P19838 is partially regulated by H2O2-mediated activation of O95819 and subsequent O95819-mediated phosphorylation of O15111. P01584 induced H2O2 production in MCF-7 cells and clearance of this ROS through the expression of P07203 reduced P19838 transcriptional activation by inhibiting O95819-mediated phosphorylation of O15111. Although O15111 and O14920 were both involved in P01584-mediated activation of P19838, only the O15111-dependent component was modulated by changes in H2O2 levels. Interestingly, in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that O95819 was activated by a very narrow range of H2O2 (1-10 microM), whereas higher concentrations (100 microM to 1 mM) inhibited O95819 activity. Treatment of cells with the general Ser\/Thr phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid) lead to activation of P19838 and enhanced O95819 activity as a O15111 kinase, suggesting that ROS may directly regulate O95819 through the inhibition of phosphatases. Recruitment of O95819 to Q9Y4K3 following P01584 stimulation was inhibited by H2O2 clearance and P63000 siRNA, suggesting that Rac-dependent NADPH oxidase may be a source of ROS required for O95819 activation. In summary, our studies have demonstrated that redox regulation of O95819 by H2O2 is mechanistically important in P01584 induction of P19838 activation.",
    "1032": "The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase P28562\/P28562\/P28562 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by Q8TCB0\/42 MAPK (5595;5594) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering P28562 proteolysis. Active P28482 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated P28562 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)\/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)\/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)\/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated P28562 proteolysis stimulated by Q02750-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)\/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) P28562 and the degradation of P28562. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) P28562 bound to P21583(Q13309) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Q13309 enhanced P28562 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Q13309 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous P28562 degradation rate in a Q13309-dependent manner. Thus, P28562 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and P21583(Q13309) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.",
    "2300": "The P35240 (P35240) tumor suppressor merlin negatively regulates cell proliferation in numerous cell types. We have previously shown that the P35240 protein (merlin\/P35240) associates with Q16584 (Q16584), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase that is required for the proliferation of normal and neoplastic cells. In this study, we show that merlin inhibits Q16584 activity, as well as the activation of its downstream effectors, P15056, P28482 (P28482) and P45983 (P45983). The ability of merlin to regulate Q16584 activity requires a direct association between Q16584 and residues in the C-terminal region of merlin. Merlin integrates Rho GTPase family signaling with MAPK activity by inhibiting the binding between Q16584 and its upstream activator, P60953. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Q16584 is required for merlin-mediated suppression of cell proliferation and invasion. Collectively, these results establish merlin as a potent inhibitor of Q16584, P28482 and P45983 activation in cancer, and provide a mechanistic link between deregulated MAPK and Rho GTPase signaling in P35240 growth control.",
    "1911": "In Caenorhabditis elegans, fem-1, P49593, and fem-3 play pivotal roles in sex determination. Recently, a mammalian homologue of the C. elegans sex-determining protein FEM-1, Q9UK73, has been described. Although there is little evidence to link Q9UK73 to sex determination, Q9UK73 and FEM-1 both promote apoptosis in mammalian cells. Here we report the identification and characterization of a human homologue of the C. elegans sex-determining protein P49593, P49593. Similar to P49593, P49593 exhibited P49593 activity and associated with FEM-3. P49593 shows striking similarity (79% amino acid identity) to rat Ca(2+)\/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (rCaMKPase). P49593 and P49593, but not P35813, were demonstrated to dephosphorylate CaM kinase II efficiently in vitro, suggesting that P49593 and P49593 are specific phosphatases for CaM kinase. Furthermore, P49593 and P49593 associated with Q9UK73 and FEM-1 respectively. Overexpression of P49593, P49593, or rCaMKPase all mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells. The catalytically active, but not the inactive, forms of P49593 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was blocked by Q07817 or a dominant negative mutant of P55211. Taken together, our data suggest that P49593 and rCaMKPase are mammalian homologues of P49593 and they are evolutionarily conserved CaM kinase phosphatases that may have a role in apoptosis signaling.",
    "2796": "In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells initiate a complex signalling pathway, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence, which provides a barrier to tumour development, involves activation of the DDR. Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we have identified 17 factors required for oncogenic P15056 to induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes. One of these factors is an F-box protein, Q5XUX0, a candidate tumour suppressor encoded in 16q24.3, a region in which there is loss of heterozygosity in breast, ovarian, hepatocellular and prostate cancers. Here we study the cellular role of Q5XUX0, identify its target substrate and determine the basis for its growth inhibitory activity. We show that ectopic expression of Q5XUX0 acts through a proteasome-directed pathway to mediate the degradation of P24385, an important regulator of progression from G1 to S phase, resulting in arrest in G1. P24385 degradation results from a direct interaction with Q5XUX0 and is dependent on the F-box motif of Q5XUX0 and phosphorylation of P24385 at Thr 286, which is known to be required for P24385 proteolysis. The involvement of the DDR in oncogene-induced senescence prompted us to investigate the role of Q5XUX0 in DNA repair. We find that DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation results in increased Q5XUX0 levels, which requires phosphorylation of Q5XUX0 by the DDR-initiating kinase ATM. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Q5XUX0 prevents cells from undergoing efficient arrest in G1 after gamma-irradiation and markedly increases sensitivity to DNA damage. Finally, we show that a variety of DNA damaging agents all result in a large increase in Q5XUX0 levels, indicating that induction of Q5XUX0 is a general response to genotoxic stress. Our results reveal Q5XUX0 as a regulator of the G1\/S transition that is specifically required for DNA damage-induced growth arrest.",
    "1308": "Q9UNU6 (Q9UNU6) catalyzes cholic acid synthesis in the liver and is feedback inhibited by bile acids. In addition to activating farnesoid Q9UBH6), bile acids also induce inflammatory cytokines in hepatocytes. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which inflammatory cytokines inhibit human Q9UNU6 gene transcription. Real-time PCR assays revealed that both chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and P01584 (P01584) markedly reduced Q9UNU6, P22680 P22680 and P41235 (P41235) mRNA expression levels in human primary hepatocytes. However, CDCA induced, but P01584 reduced, small heterodimer partner (Q15466) mRNA expression. P01584 inhibited human Q9UNU6 reporter activity only in liver cells, and a P45983 (P45983)-specific inhibitor-blocked P01584 inhibition. Activated P45983 or P05412 inhibited, whereas their dominant negative forms blocked, P01584 inhibition of Q9UNU6 transcription. Mutagenesis analyses mapped an P01584 response element to a previously identified bile acid response element, which contains an P41235 binding site. A dominant negative P41235 inhibited Q9UNU6 gene transcription and ectopically expressed P41235 blocked P01584 inhibition. Furthermore, P01584 inhibited P41235 gene transcription, protein expression, and binding to the Q9UNU6 gene. P45983 phosphorylated P41235 and a P45983-specific inhibitor blocked the P01584 inhibition of P41235 expression. These results suggest that P01584 inhibits Q9UNU6 gene transcription via a mitogen-activated protein kinase\/P45983 pathway that inhibits P41235 gene expression and its DNA-binding ability. This mechanism may play an important role in the adaptive response to inflammatory cytokines and in the protection of the liver during cholestasis.",
    "172": "D-sites are a class of MAPK-docking sites that have been found in many MAPK regulators and substrates. A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) Q02750, P36507, P46734, P45985, and P52564. Here we demonstrated that O14733 recognizes its target P45983-1 by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of O14733. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind P45983-1 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length O14733 containing combined D1\/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to P45983-1 and exhibited reduced P45983-1 kinase activity when compared with wild-type O14733. Peptide versions of the D-sites from P45985 or the Q9UQF2 scaffold protein inhibited O14733-P45983-1 binding, suggesting that all three P45983-1 regulators bind to the same region of P45983-1. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of O14733 inhibited the ability of P45983-1 and P45984 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates P05412 and P15336, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with O14733 for docking to P45983-1. Finally, O14733-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of P45983-1 versus P28482. We conclude that O14733 contains three P45983-1-docking sites that interact to selectively bind P45983-1 and contribute to P45983-1 signal transmission and specificity.",
    "210": "Q9Y6Q9\/Q9Y6Q9) is an oncogene that is amplified and overexpressed in many human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate 'activated Q9Y6Q9 oncoprotein' turnover during tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that O43791 (O43791), a Q13618 (Q13618)-based ubiquitin ligase, is responsible for Q9Y6Q9 ubiquitination and proteolysis. O43791 interacts directly with an Q9Y6Q9 phospho-degron in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Casein kinase I phosphorylates the S102 in this degron and promotes O43791-dependent turnover of Q9Y6Q9. Short hairpin RNA knockdown and overexpression experiments substantiated that the O43791\/Q13618\/P62877 ubiquitin ligase complex promotes Q9Y6Q9 turnover. A systematic analysis of the O43791 genomic locus revealed that a high percentage of genomic loss or loss of heterozygosity occurs at this locus in breast cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoration of O43791 expression inhibited Q9Y6Q9-mediated oncogenic signaling and tumorigenesis, thus positioning O43791 as a tumor suppressor."
